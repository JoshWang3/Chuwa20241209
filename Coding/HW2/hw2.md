## Coding Assignments


### Encapsulation

In the **_Encapsulation_** class, I create a class that 
contains several user information, including username, email and password.

### Polymorphism

In the **_Animal_** class, I create the **_makeSound_** class that specify that all animals will make sounds.
Then in the **_Dog_** class, by extending **_Animal_** class, we could specify the dog sound as "Woof".
We could see the output in the **_Polymorphism_** class.

### Inheritance
In the **_Animal_** class, I create the **_eat_** class that specify that all animals will eat food.
Then in the **_Dog_** class, by extending **_Animal_** class, Dog will directly inherit **_eat_** class.
We could see the output in the **_Inheritance_** class.
