/*
The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to create a one-to-many dependency between objects.
This means when one object (called the Subject) changes its state,
all its dependents (called Observers) are notified automatically and updated.

Loose Coupling: The subject and observers are loosely coupled.
The subject doesn't need to know the concrete class of the observer.

Real-World Examples:
    News subscription: Subscribe to a newsletter (subject), and when thereâ€™s new content, all subscribers (observers) get notified.
    UI Event Listeners: Buttons notify event listeners (observers) when clicked.

 Benefits:
    Promotes loose coupling between subject and observers.
    Supports dynamic subscription: observers can be added/removed at runtime.
    Makes code more flexible and scalable.
