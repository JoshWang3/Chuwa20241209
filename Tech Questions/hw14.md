### 3. What is the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), explain with detailed use cases
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to separate cross-cutting concerns from the main application logic. In AOP, cross-cutting concerns are functionalities that are used across different parts of an application, such as logging, security, transaction management, and error handling. AOP achieves this separation by defining aspects, which encapsulate these cross-cutting concerns, and applying them to specific points in the application code called join points.

```java
// An Aspect that logs method execution time
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
    public void beforeMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method execution started");
    }
    
    @After("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
    public void afterMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method execution completed");
    }
    
    @Around("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))") // 拦截com.example.myapp.service包下所有方法
    public Object aroundMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Method execution time: " + (end - start) + "ms");
        return result;
    }
}
```
```java
// Enable AOP in the Spring Boot application
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
```java
// Use AOP in a service class
@Service
public class MyService {
    public void performTask() {
        System.out.println("Performing task...");
    }
}
```

### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- Advantages:
    - Separation of concerns: AOP allows for the separation of cross-cutting concerns from the main application logic, improving code modularity and maintainability.
    - Reusability: Aspects can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication.
    - Improved readability: AOP helps in improving the readability of the code by isolating common functionalities in aspects.
    - Scalability: AOP provides a scalable way to add new functionalities to an application without modifying existing code.

- Disadvantages:
    - Complexity: AOP introduces additional complexity to the application, especially for developers who are not familiar with the AOP concepts.
    - Debugging: Debugging AOP-related issues can be challenging, as the flow of control is distributed across different parts of the application.
    - Performance overhead: AOP can introduce performance overhead due to the additional processing required for intercepting method calls and executing aspects.

### 5. Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer

1. Aspect: An aspect is a modular unit of cross-cutting concerns that encapsulates a set of behaviors or functionalities that can be applied to multiple parts of an application. Aspects define the logic that needs to be executed, like logging, security, or transaction management.
2. PointCut: A set of rules that define where an aspect should be applied in the application code. Pointcuts specify the join points where the aspect's behavior should run, such as method execution, field access, or exception handling.
```java
@Pointcut("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))") // Pointcut expression to match service methods that runs at com.example.myapp.service package
public void serviceMethods() {}
```
3. JoinPoint: A specific point in the application code where an aspect can be applied. Join points include method execution, field access, constructor invocation, and exception handling. Aspects can intercept and execute additional logic at these join points.
```java
@Before("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
public void log(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Method execution started: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
}
```
4. Advice: The action or behavior that an aspect performs at a specific join point. There are different types of advice in AOP, such as before advice, after advice, around advice, and after-throwing advice, each executing at different points in the method execution lifecycle.

### 6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.

We declare a pointcut using "@Pointcut" annotation followed by a method definition that specifies the pointcut expression, which defines the join points where an aspect should be applied.  
We can declare a pointcut without an empty method. For example:
```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* com.example.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
    public void beforeMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method execution started");
    }
}
```
Here, the @Before annotation directly defines the pointcut expression, this approach works fine but lacks reusability.

### 7. Compare different types of advice in Spring AOP

1. @Before: Before the method execution
2. @After: After the method execution
3. @AfterReturning: After the method returns a value
4. @AfterThrowing: After the method throws an exception
5. @Around: Around the method execution, allowing to control the method invocation
