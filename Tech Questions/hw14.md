## Questions:

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md (your own cheatsheet).
Check annotations.md

### 2.


### 3. What is Aspect-Oriented Programming? Explain it with detailed use cases.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that helps separate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transaction management) from the main application logic. AOP works by intercepting method calls and injecting additional behavior.
1. Logging: Automatically log method entry/exit across the application.
2. Tracing
3. Exception Handling 
4. Security Management: Check user roles before executing sensitive operations.
5. Application Monitoring: Measure method execution time.


### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:
   1. Modularity: Separates cross-cutting concerns from business logic.
   2. Reusability: Common logic can be reused across different components.
   3. Ease of Maintenance: Changes to cross-cutting concerns are easier.
   4. Declarative Programming: Reduces boilerplate code.

Disadvantages:
   1. Complexity: Debugging can be harder due to method interception.
   2. Overhead: Slight performance overhead during method interception.
   3. Learning Curve: Developers need to understand AOP concepts like JoinPoint and Pointcut.

### 5. Explain the following concepts:
1. Aspect: A module that contains cross-cutting logic (e.g., logging, security).

2. PointCut: Pointcuts determine join points of interest and thus enable us to control when advice runs.
```
@Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public void serviceLayer() {}

```

3. JoinPoint: A point during program execution, such as a method call or exception handling.
```
@Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public void log(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Method: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
}
```

4. Advice: The action taken at a particular join point.
   Types: @Before, @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, @Around

### 6. How do we declare a PointCut? Can we declare it without annotating an empty method?
Declare a PointCut using @Pointcut. Declaring an empty method is optional but improves readability and reusability.
```
package com.xyz;

public class Pointcuts {

	@Pointcut("execution(public * *(..))")
	public void publicMethod() {} 

	@Pointcut("within(com.xyz.trading..*)")
	public void inTrading() {} 

	@Pointcut("publicMethod() && inTrading()")
	public void tradingOperation() {} 
}
```


### 7. Compare different types of advice in Spring AOP.
@Before: Before the method execution.
@After:	After the method execution (success or failure).
@AfterReturning: After the method returns successfully.
@AfterThrowing:	After the method throws an exception.
@Around: Before and after the method execution.

### 8. On top of your Spring application which you did:
1. Implement a customized logger using Spring AOP, your logger should be able to log your code and also external code.
2. Your AOP logger should log method execution time, Rest API request details, and response details.
3. Your AOP logger should log with all possible joint points (before method execution, after method execution, etc.).
4. You should bind jointPoints with your AOP code directly, instead of binding it with an empty method.
