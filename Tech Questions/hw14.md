# Homework 14

## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?
AOP modularizes cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) by separating them from core business logic.

- **Key Concepts**
  - **Aspect**: Reusable module for cross-cutting functionality.
  - **Join Point**: Execution points (e.g., method calls).
  - **Pointcut**: Rules to select join points.
  - **Advice**: Action executed at join points (before, after, around).
  - **Weaving**: Integrating aspects into the main code.

- **Use Cases**
  1. **Logging**  
    Automatically log method executions across the application without cluttering business logic.

  2. **Security**  
    Centralize authentication/authorization checks for specific methods or classes.

  3. **Transaction Management**  
    Handle database transactions (start/commit/rollback) transparently for data operations.

  4. **Performance Monitoring**  
    Track execution time of methods to identify bottlenecks.

  5. **Error Handling**  
    Centralize exception logging or recovery strategies.

- **Benefits**: Reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and keeps core logic focused.


## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- **Advantages**
  1. **Seamless Spring Integration**  
    Works natively with Spring-managed beans, ideal for Spring-based applications.
  2. **Simplicity**  
    Uses annotations/XML configuration (no complex setup or bytecode manipulation).
  3. **Proxy-Based Approach**  
    No need for special compilers (runtime weaving via JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB).
  4. **Low Learning Curve**  
    Easier to adopt for developers already familiar with Spring.
  5. **Lightweight**  
    Built into Spring Core, avoiding heavy dependencies like AspectJ.

- **Disadvantages**
  1. **Limited Join Points**  
    Only supports method execution join points (no field/constructor interception).
  2. **Spring Bean Restriction**  
    Applies only to Spring-managed beans, not arbitrary objects.
  3. **Performance Overhead**  
    Proxy creation and method interception add minor runtime costs.
  4. **No Compile-Time Weaving**  
    Less optimized than AspectJ for complex scenarios.
  5. **Partial AOP Support**  
    Missing advanced features like fine-grained control over aspect precedence.

- **Best For**: Simple cross-cutting concerns in Spring applications.  
- **Avoid For**: Complex AOP needs (use AspectJ instead).


## 5. Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
1. Aspect
2. PointCut
3. JoinPoint
4. Advice

- 1. Aspect  
  A modular unit encapsulating cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security).  
  **Example**: A `LoggingAspect` that logs method executions across the application.

- 2. PointCut  
  A predicate defining **where** advice should be applied (e.g., targeting specific methods/classes).  
  **Example**: `@Pointcut("execution(* com.service.*.*(..))")` selects all methods in the `service` package.

- 3. JoinPoint  
  A specific **point** in code execution (e.g., method invocation, exception handling).  
  **Examples**: Method calls, field access, object instantiation.

- 4. Advice  
  The **action** taken at a join point. Types include:  
  - `@Before`: Runs before the join point.  
  - `@After`: Runs after the join point (success or failure).  
  - `@Around`: Wraps the join point (controls execution flow).  
  - `@AfterReturning`: Runs after successful execution.  
  - `@AfterThrowing`: Runs if an exception is thrown.

- **Relationship**:  
  Aspect = PointCut (where) + Advice (what).  
  Advice executes at JoinPoints filtered by PointCut.

## 6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.
- **Declaring Pointcuts**
  1. **With Empty Method**:  
    Use `@Pointcut` on an empty method (standard for reusability).  
  2. **Without Empty Method**:  
    Define expressions inline in advice annotations (e.g., `@Before("execution(...)")`).


- **Common Pointcut Expressions**
  - **Execution Path**: Target methods by signature (e.g., `execution(* com.service.*.*(..))`).  
  - **Within Scope**: Target classes/packages (e.g., `within(com.controller..*)`).  
  - **Annotations**: Target methods/classes with annotations (e.g., `@annotation(Loggable)`).  
  - **Arguments**: Filter by parameter types (e.g., `args(java.lang.String)`).  
  - **Bean Names**: Target beans by name patterns (e.g., `bean(userService*)`).  
  - **Combined Logic**: Use `&&`, `||`, `!` for complex rules (e.g., `execution(* save*(..)) && within(com.dao.*)`).  



- **Key Takeaways**  
  - **Reusable Pointcuts**: Use `@Pointcut` methods for cross-cutting logic shared across multiple advices.  
  - **Inline Expressions**: Suitable for simple, one-time use cases without method annotations.  
  - **Flexibility**: Combine expressions to precisely target join points. 

## 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.

| **Advice Type**     | **Execution Timing**               | **Key Use Cases**                  | **Control Over Execution**       | **Exception Handling**           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **@Before**          | Before method execution            | Logging, security checks, validation | No control over method execution | Cannot handle exceptions          |
| **@After**           | After method completes (success/error) | Resource cleanup, post-processing  | No control over outcome          | Can detect but not alter outcome  |
| **@AfterReturning**  | After method **success**           | Processing return values, success logging | Access return value              | Not triggered by exceptions       |
| **@AfterThrowing**   | After method **throws exception**  | Error logging, recovery actions     | Access thrown exception          | Handles specific exceptions       |
| **@Around**          | Wraps method execution             | Transaction management, performance monitoring | Full control (proceed/stop/modify args/return) | Can catch and handle exceptions   |



- **Key Differences**
  1. **Flexibility**:  
    - `@Around` > Others (full control over method flow).  
  2. **Exception Access**:  
    - `@AfterThrowing` and `@Around` can directly handle exceptions.  
  3. **Return Value Access**:  
    - `@AfterReturning` and `@Around` can access/modify return values.  
  4. **Execution Flow**:  
    - Only `@Around` can prevent method execution (e.g., via conditional checks).  



- **Best Practices**:  
  - Use `@Before`/`@After` for simple pre/post actions.  
  - Use `@Around` for complex logic requiring full control.  
  - Combine `@AfterReturning` and `@AfterThrowing` for success/error branching.
