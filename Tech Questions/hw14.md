3. AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
   1. Logging: automatically log methods calls and execution times without cluttering the business logic. 
   2. Security: Apply access control checks across different layers or methods in the application.
4. 
   1. Pros:
      1. Separation of Concerns: AOP separates cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic.
      2. Improved Code Reusability: Common functionalities like logging and security can be reused across multiple modules.
   2. Cons:
      1. Learning Curve: Requires understanding of new concepts such as aspects, pointcuts, and join points. 
      2. Runtime Overhead: AOP introduces some performance overhead due to proxy object creation and method interception.
5. 
   1. Aspect: An aspect is a modularization of cross-cutting concerns. It contains the logic that can be applied at various join points.
   2. PointCut: A pointcut defines where the advice should be applied. It is a set of join points satisfying a specific condition.
   3. JoinPoint: A join point represents a point in the application where an action can be intercepted, such as method execution.
   4. Advice: Advice is the action to take before, after, or around a join point.
6. Pointcuts are typically declared using the @Pointcut annotation in Spring AOP. Yes, you can directly declare pointcuts inline within advice annotations.
7. 
   1. Before Advice: Executed before the join point method.
   2. After Advice: Executed after the join point method, regardless of its outcome.
   3. AfterReturning Advice: Executed after the join point method successfully completes.
   4. AfterThrowing Advice: Executed if the join point method throws an exception.
   5. Around Advice: Wraps around the join point, allowing custom behavior before and after method execution.
