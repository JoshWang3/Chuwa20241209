### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

### 2. Briefly reading: https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions

### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing "aspects" as a new modular unit. Unlike OOP’s focus on classes, AOP’s aspects capture crosscutting concerns (like transaction management) that span multiple classes, making them easier to isolate and manage.
- **Examples**
- Automatically registering objects in JMX for remote management. If a class is annotated with our @AutoRegister annotation, we have an aspect that watches for new instantiations of that class and registers them in JMX automatically.
- Audit logging (the gold standard AOP use case). Its the general approach is to annotate methods that represent some auditable action.
### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- **advantages:**
- reducing code duplication, improving modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns (like logging, transaction management) into separate aspects, and easy integration with the Spring ecosystem; 
- **disadvantages** 
- potential debugging complexity, limited join point support compared to frameworks like AspectJ, and potential performance overhead due to proxy creation and weaving at runtime
### 5. Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
#### 1. Aspect
- The core unit of AOP, representing a modularization of a cross-cutting concern.
#### 2. PointCut
- A predicate that matches join points. It defines where advice should be applied.
#### 3. JoinPoint
- A specific point in the execution of a program, such as a method call or exception handling.
#### 4. Advice
- The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point.
### 6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.
- **Using an Annotation on an Empty Method (Named Pointcut)**
- **Inline Pointcut Declarations**
- **Common Pointcut Expressions**
- **XML Configuration**
- Yes we can,like that:
```


Thought for a second
Yes. You can inline the pointcut expression directly in your advice annotation instead of using a @Pointcut on an empty method. For example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBeforeServiceMethods() {
        System.out.println("Before advice: Logging for service methods.");
    }
}
```
### 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.
| **Advice Type**    | **When It Runs**                                             | **Can Access Return Value?**                   | **Handles Exception?**                                        | **Typical Use Cases**                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Before**         | Before target method execution                               | No                                             | No                                                             | Logging, security checks, or initial setup                                    |
| **After (Finally)**| After target method execution (both success or exception)    | No                                             | Can’t handle, but can detect                                   | Cleanup, releasing resources                                                  |
| **After Returning**| After target method returns successfully                     | Yes                                            | No                                                             | Logging returned results, post-processing of results                          |
| **After Throwing** | After target method throws an exception                      | No                                             | Handles logging, cannot stop exception propagation            | Error logging, exception handling                                             |
| **Around**         | Surrounds the entire method invocation process              | Yes (by capturing `proceed()` result)          | Yes (try-catch within advice)                                 | Transactions, performance measurements, controlling flow                      |
### 8. On top of your Spring application which you did in Assignment #11,
#### 1. Implement a customized logger using Spring AOP, your logger should be able to log your code and also external code.
#### 2. Your AOP logger should log method execution time, Rest API request details and response details.
#### 3. Your AOP logger should log with all possible joint points (before method execution, after method execution etc...)
#### 4. Your should bind jointPoints with your AOP code directly, instead of binding it with an empty method.
#### 5. Be ready to demo your implementation and prove it works in class.
