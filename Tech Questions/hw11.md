# HW11
## Questions:

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md (your own cheatsheet).
Check annotations.md

### 2. Compare Spring and Spring Boot. What are the benefits of Spring Boot?
1. Spring: Framework providing Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, and Test. Requires manual configuration of XML/Java-based beans.
2. Spring Boot: Built on top of Spring, offering auto configuration and embedded Tomcat server.
Benefits: 1. Provides an embedded server for deployment. 2. Offers monitoring and health checks features 3. Reduces configuration efforts

### 3. What is IoC and what is DI?
- Inversion of Control (IoC):
Spring controls the object lifecycle and dependency instead of the programmer.

- Dependency Injection (DI):
  Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods, ensuring loose coupling between the classes.


### 4. What is `@ComponentScan`?
Tells Spring where to scan for components annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller.


### 5. What is `@SpringBootApplication`?
It combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan, making the application can use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra configuration.

### 6. How many ways to define a bean? Provide code examples.
1. Use XML configuration, 2. use @Bean/@Configuration annotation


### 7. What is the default bean name for `@Component` and `@Bean`? Also compare `@Component` and `@Bean`.
@Component: The class name in camel case (e.g., myBean for MyBean).
@Bean: The method name in the configuration class.

Compare:
@Component: Will automatically discovered by @ComponentScan.
@Bean: Explicitly declared in @Configuration classes.


### 8. Compare `@Component` and `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.
- @Component: Generic stereotype for Spring managed components.
- @Service: Specialization of @Component for service logic.
- @Repository: Specialization of @Component for data access layers. Includes exception translation.
- @Controller: Specialization of @Component for MVC controllers.


### 9. Explain `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, `@Resource`, and `@Primary`.
- @Autowired: Automatically injects dependencies by type.
- @Qualifier: Specifies the exact bean to inject when multiple beans exist.
- @Resource: Java's standard annotation for dependency injection (similar to @Autowired).
- @Primary: Marks a bean as the default when multiple beans exist.

### 10. How many annotations can we use to inject a bean?
Can use `@Autowired`, `@Resource` and `@Inject` 


### 11. Explain and compare different types of dependency injection, their pros and cons, and use cases.
1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies provided through the constructor which promotes immutability.
2. Setter Injection: Dependencies injected through setter methods, allows optional dependencies.
3. Field Injection: Injected directly into fields. It's the simplest DI to implement but harder to test.


### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one as primary? How does Spring IoC pick one bean to inject if no primary is defined? Provide examples.
Use @Primary to mark the default bean:
```
@Primary
@Component
public class Bean {
}

```

We can use @Qualifier to specify which bean to use:
```
@Autowired
@Qualifier("specificBean")
private MyBean bean;
```

### 13. Compare `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext` in the Spring framework.
- BeanFactory is the Core IoC container. Use lazy initialization of beans.

- ApplicationContext is a superset of BeanFactory. Includes additional features like event handling and internationalization.


### 14. Explain bean scope in Spring IoC. List bean scopes with explanations and code examples if possible.
1. Singleton - Single instance per Spring container
```
@Scope("singleton")
@Component
public class SingletonBean {
}

```
2. Prototype - A new instance is created for every request.
```
@Scope("prototype")
@Component
public class PrototypeBean {
}
```
3. Request - new bean instance created for a HTTP request
4. Session - new bean instance created for a HTTP request


### 15. Write a Spring application that registers and autowires beans
Please check Coding/HW11/Q15/

### 16. Explain Builder Pattern with Code Examples
It's a design pattern that allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step manner, where the construction process can change based on the type of product being built. This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
The components have: Product, Builder, ConcreteBuilder, Director, and Client.
Please check Coding/HW11/Q16/

### 17. Clone https://github.com/CTYue/springIOC, go through examples, make code in both main and main-loose coupling work.
use @Qualifier to specify the bean or remove @Primary in BeanConfig.java
