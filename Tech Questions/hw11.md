\2. Compare Spring and Springboot? What are the benfits of Srpingboot?

```
Spring: A comprehensive framework for Java applications with extensive configuration.
Spring Boot: A sub-project of Spring, simplifying application setup with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and minimal boilerplate.
Benefits of Spring Boot: Faster development, less configuration, embedded servers, and easier integration.
```

\3. What is IOC and What is DI?

```
IoC (Inversion of Control): Framework controls object creation and lifecycle.
DI (Dependency Injection): IoC technique where dependencies are injected rather than being created internally.
```

\4. What is @CompnonentScan ?

```
Scans specified packages for components (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) to register as beans.
```

\5. What is @SpringbootApplication ?

```
A meta-annotation combining @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan for Spring Boot applications.
```

\6. How many ways to define a bean? Provide code examples.

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

\7. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean ? Also compare @Component and @Bean .

```
@Component: Class name in camel case
@Bean: Method name.

@Component: Class-level, automatic scanning.
@Bean: Method-level, explicit definition in @Configuration classes.
```

\8. Compare @component and @service , @repository , @controller ?

```
@Component: Generic component.
@Service: For service layer.
@Repository: For DAO layer
@Controller: For web controllers, used in MVC.
```

\9. Explain @Autowired , @Qualifier , @Resource and @Primary ?

```
@Autowired: Injects dependencies by type.
@Qualifier: Specifies which bean to inject.
@Resource: Injects by name, then type.
@Primary: Marks a bean as the primary candidate for injection.
```

\10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject a bean?

```
@Autowired, @Resource, @Inject.
```

\11. Explain and compare differnet types of denpendency injection, their pros and cons, and use cases.

```
Constructor Injection: Immutable dependencies, required dependencies.
Setter Injection: Optional dependencies, allows re-injection.
Field Injection: Simplifies code, hard to test, not recommended
```

\12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how Spring IOC picks one bean to inject if no primary, demo with code examples.

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class PrimaryBean implements MyService {
}

@Component
public class SecondaryBean implements MyService {
}

@Service
public class MyConsumer {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyConsumer(@Qualifier("secondaryBean") MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }
}
```

\13. Compare BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring framework?

```
BeanFactory: Basic, lazy-loading.
ApplicationContext: Extends BeanFactory, with additional features like AOP, internationalization, and event propagation.
```

\14. Explain bean scope in Spring IOC? List bean scopes with explainations and code examples if possible.

```
Singleton: One instance per Spring container.
Prototype: New instance for each request.
Request: One instance per HTTP request (Web apps).
Session: One instance per HTTP session (Web apps).
GlobalSession: One instance per global session (Portlets).
```

\16. Explain builder pattern with code examples.  

```java
//Creational design pattern for constructing complex objects step-by-step.

public class User {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    private User(Builder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.age = builder.age;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Builder name(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder age(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}

User user = new User.Builder()
    .name("Erin")
    .age(99)
    .build();
```
