### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md (your own cheatsheet).

### 2. Compare Spring and Springboot? What are the benfits of Srpingboot?
- Spring is a comprehensive Java application framework providing a wide range of features for building enterprise-level applications, while Spring Boot is an extension of Spring that focuses on simplifying development by providing auto-configuration and conventions, allowing developers to quickly build standalone applications with minimal configuration overhead; essentially, Spring Boot aims to accelerate Spring development by reducing boilerplate code and configuration steps, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and building microservices.
### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
- IoC（Inversion of Control） is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework.
- （DI）Dependency injection is a pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object’s dependencies.
### 4. What is @CompnonentScan ?
- @ComponentScan is an annotation used in Spring to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components. By default, it scans the package of the class that declares it and its sub-packages.
### 5. What is @SpringbootApplication ?
- The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a meta-annotation in Spring Boot that combines several other critical Spring annotations to simplify the setup and configuration of the Spring Boot application.
- The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a combination of @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
### 6. How many ways to define a bean? Provide code examples.
- Creating Bean Inside an XML Configuration File (beans.xml)
```
// Java Program to Illustrate Student Class
 
// Class
public class Student {
 
    // Class data members
    private int id;
    private String studentName;
 
    // Method
    public void displayInfo()
    {
        // Print statement
        System.out.println("Student Name is " + studentName
                           + " and Roll Number is " + id);
    }
}
```
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
 
    <bean id="studentAmiya" class="Student">
 
    </bean>
 
</beans>
```
- Using @Component Annotation
```
// Java Program to Illustrate College Class
 
package ComponentAnnotation;
 
// Class
public class College {
 
    // Method
    public void test()
    {
        // Print statement
        // whenever this method is called
        System.out.println("Test College Method");
    }
}
```
```
// Java Program to Illustrate College Class
 
package ComponentAnnotation;
 
// Importing required classes
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
 
@Component("collegeBean")
 
// Class
public class College {
 
    // Method
    public void test()
    {
        // Print statement
        System.out.println("Test College Method");
    }
}
```
- Using @Bean Annotation
```
package BeanAnnotation;
 
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
 
public class College {
 
    public void test(){
        System.out.println("Test College Method");
    }
}
```
```
package ComponentAnnotation;
 
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
 
@Configuration
public class CollegeConfig {
 
}
```
```
// Java Program to Illustrate Configuration in College Class
 
package BeanAnnotation;
 
// Importing required classes
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
 
@Configuration
public class CollegeConfig {
 
    // Using Bean annotation to create
    // College class Bean
    @Bean
 
    // Here the method name is the
    // bean id/bean name
    public College collegeBean()
    {
 
        // Return the College object
        return new College();
    }
}
```
### 7. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean ? Also compare @Component and @Bean .
- **Using @Component**
- When you annotate a class with @Component without specifying a name, Spring will use the default bean naming strategy. By default, the bean name will be the unqualified class name with the first letter lowercased.
```
@Component
public class MyService { }
```
The default bean name will be "myService".
- - **Using @Bean**
- When you annotate a method with @Bean without specifying a name, the default bean name will be the name of the method itself.
```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```
The default bean name will be "myService".
- The default bean name for a component is the decapitalized class name, while for a bean method, it is the method name.

### 8. Compare @component and @service , @repository , @controller ?
- **@Component**：generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
- **@Repository**：stereotype for persistence layer.
- **@Service**：stereotype for service layer.
- **@Controller**：stereotype for presentation layer (spring-mvc).
### 9. Explain @Autowired , @Qualifier , @Resource and @Primary ?
- **@Autowired:** Injects dependencies by type.
- **@Qualifier:** Specifies which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist.
- **@Resource:** Similar to @Autowired but prioritizes injection by bean name.
- **@Primary:** Marks a default bean to be used when multiple beans of the same type are present and no further specification is given.
### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject a bean?
- The number of annotations used to inject a bean depends on the type of injection and the annotations used. For example, the @Inject annotation can be used to define an injection point, while the @Qualifier and @Primary annotations can be used to control which beans are injected.
### 11. Explain and compare differnet types of denpendency injection, their pros and cons, and use cases.
| Injection Type | Pros                                                                     | Cons                                                       | Best Use Case                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Constructor    | Immutability, complete initialization, testable                          | Constructor bloat with many parameters, circular refs      | Mandatory dependencies, robust design  |
| Setter         | Handles optional dependencies, flexible reconfiguration, easier circular dependency management | Potential for incomplete setup, mutable                    | Optional dependencies, changing dependencies |
| Field          | Simplicity, minimal code                                                 | Harder to test, non-final fields, hidden dependencies      | Quick prototypes, simple projects      |
### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how Spring IOC picks one bean to inject if no primary, demo with code examples.
- Marking a Bean as Primary
```
@Component
@Primary
public class PrimaryService implements MyService {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Primary Service executing...");
    }
}

@Component
public class SecondaryService implements MyService {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Secondary Service executing...");
    }
}
```
- Injecting the Bean
```
@Component
public class Consumer {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public Consumer(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public void doWork() {
        myService.execute();
    }
}
```

### 13. Compare BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring framework?
- For most applications, ApplicationContext is the recommended choice due to its extensive features and seamless integration with other Spring modules.
- BeanFactory is suitable for scenarios where resource usage is a concern or when fine-grained control over bean instantiation is required.
### 14. Explain bean scope in Spring IOC? List bean scopes with explainations and code examples if possible.
- In Spring IOC, a bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the Spring container. It determines how many instances of a bean are created and how long they live.
```
@Component
public class SingletonBean {
    // ...
}
```
### 15. Write a Spring application that registers and autowires beans,
#### - Demo different types of dependency injection
#### - Demo bean scopes.
#### - Demo dependency injection by type and by name, when there's ambiguity in bean definition.
#### - Demo bean registration by both @Component and @Bean

### 16. Explain builder pattern with code examples.
- The Builder Pattern is a design pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, making the creation process more readable and flexible, especially when an object has many optional parameters.
```
public class Computer {
    private String CPU;
    private String RAM;
    private String storage;

    // Private constructor that only the Builder can use
    private Computer(Builder builder) {
        this.CPU = builder.CPU;
        this.RAM = builder.RAM;
        this.storage = builder.storage;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Computer{" +
               "CPU='" + CPU + '\'' +
               ", RAM='" + RAM + '\'' +
               ", storage='" + storage + '\'' +
               '}';
    }

    // Static nested Builder class
    public static class Builder {
        private String CPU;
        private String RAM;
        private String storage;

        public Builder setCPU(String CPU) {
            this.CPU = CPU;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setRAM(String RAM) {
            this.RAM = RAM;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setStorage(String storage) {
            this.storage = storage;
            return this;
        }

        // Build method to create a Computer object
        public Computer build() {
            return new Computer(this);
        }
    }
}
```
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer myComputer = new Computer.Builder()
                                  .setCPU("Intel i7")
                                  .setRAM("16GB")
                                  .setStorage("512GB SSD")
                                  .build();

        System.out.println(myComputer);
    }
}
```
