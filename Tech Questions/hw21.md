### 1.Practice collection

### 2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?
```
checked:exceptions must be handled during compile time

try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("file");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

unchecked:exceptions occur at runtime and don’t require handling

String str = null;
// Throws NullPointerException
System.out.println(str.length()); 
```

### 3. Can there be multiple finally blocks? 
```
no only one
```

### 4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result?
```
return the value in final block
```

### 5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception? what is Compile/Checked Exception?
```
checked:exceptions must be handled during compile time
unchecked:exceptions occur at runtime and don’t require handling
```

### 6. What is the difference between throw and throws?
```
The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly. It can throw only one exception at a time
The throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by a comma
```

### 7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime 
exception before Exception ?
```
Null/Runtime exception is sub class of Exception
```

### 8. What is optional? why do you use it? write an optional example. 
```
Optional is a container in Java used to represent a value that may not be present, helping to avoid NullPointerException.

Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);

```

### 10. What are the types of design patterns in Java ?
```
Predefined templates to solve common programming problems.Ensure code is more readable, maintainable, and scalable.

```

### 11. What are the SOLID Principles ?
```
Single Responsibility Principle
Open/Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion Principle
```

### 12. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?
```
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 13. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?
```
The Open-Closed Principle means software entities should be open for extension (new functionality added) but closed for modification (existing code remains unchanged). It ensures flexibility and stability.
```

### 14.Liskov’s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be 
substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your answer.
```
1
```

### 15. Watch the design pattern video, and type the code, submit it to MavenProject folder
