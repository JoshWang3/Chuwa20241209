## Questions:

### Part 2. 

1. CREATE KEYSPACE chuwa WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
   1. USE chuwa;
   
2. and 3. CREATE TABLE trainee_information (
   trainee_id UUID,
   full_name TEXT,
   email TEXT,
   department TEXT,
   join_date TIMESTAMP,
   PRIMARY KEY ((department), join_date)
   );
   
   1. describe tables;
   
4. and 5.
INSERT INTO trainee_information (trainee_id, full_name, email, department, join_date)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', 'Engineering', toTimestamp(now()));

INSERT INTO trainee_information (trainee_id, full_name, email, department, join_date)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', 'HR', toTimestamp(now()));

INSERT INTO trainee_information (trainee_id, full_name, email, department, join_date)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Charlie Davis', 'charlie@example.com', 'Engineering', toTimestamp(now()));
    
    1. SELECT * FROM trainee_information;

6. Flexible Schema
   1. INSERT INTO trainee_information (trainee_id, full_name, department, join_date)
      VALUES (uuid(), 'Daniel Brown', 'Sales', toTimestamp(now()));
   2. ALTER TABLE trainee_information ADD phone_number TEXT; (new col)
   3. INSERT INTO trainee_information (trainee_id, full_name, department, join_date, phone_number)
      VALUES (uuid(), 'Eva Green', 'Marketing', toTimestamp(now()), '+1234567890');

7. Why for Query-First Design
   Cassandraâ€™s schema is designed based on query patterns.
   **Partition Key** department for efficient lookup.
   **Clustering Key** join_date for sorting within a partition.
   1. ```
      SELECT * FROM trainee_information WHERE department = 'Engineering' ORDER BY join_date DESC;
      ```
      

8. Explain Cassandra Consistency Levels
- ONE: only one node returns the data (Fast but less consistent).
- QUORUM: The majority of replicas respond (Balance of speed & consistency).
- ALL: All replicas nodes respond for operation (Strongest consistency, but slowest).
- LOCAL_QUORUM:	The majority of replicas within a single data center. Ensures consistency and avoids the latency of inter-datacenter communication.
