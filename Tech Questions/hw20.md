## 2. What are **Wrapper Classes** in Java and why do we need them?

**Answer:**  
Wrapper classes in Java are classes that encapsulate primitive data types into objects. For example, `int` has `Integer`, `double` has `Double`, etc.

 Why do we need them?
- To use primitives in Collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) since these require objects.
- They provide utility methods for primitives like conversion, parsing, and comparison.

## 3. What is the difference between **HashMap** and **HashTable**?

**Answer:**  

| Feature               | **HashMap**                                  | **HashTable**                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Synchronization**   | Not synchronized (not thread-safe)           | Synchronized (thread-safe)     |
| **Null Keys/Values**  | Allows one null key and multiple null values | Does not allow null keys/values|
| **Performance**       | Faster                                       | Slower due to synchronization  |
| **Introduced In**     | Java 1.2 (part of Collections Framework)     | Legacy class (pre-Collections) |

## 4. What is **String Pool** in Java and why do we need it?

**Answer:**  
The String Pool is a special memory area in the Java heap where string literals are stored. If a string already exists in the pool, it will reuse that instance instead of creating a new one.

Why do we need it?
- Saves memory by avoiding duplicate string objects.
- Improves performance due to faster access to strings.

---

## 5. What is Java **Garbage Collection**?

**Answer:**  
Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is an automatic process that reclaims unused memory by destroying objects that are no longer in use. It Managed by JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
 It uses algorithms like Mark-and-Sweep, G1GC, and CMS. It helps avoid memory leaks and optimizes memory usage.

## 6. What are **Access Modifiers** and their scopes in Java?

**Answer:**  
Java provides four access modifiers:

| **Modifier**  | **Scope**                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **public**    | Accessible from any class.                                  |
| **protected** | Accessible within the package and by subclasses.            |
| **default**   | Accessible within the package only (no modifier specified). |
| **private**   | Accessible only within the same class.                      |

## 7. What is the **final** keyword? (Field, Method, Class)

**Answer:**
- **Field**: A final field cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- **Method**: A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **Class**: A final class cannot be extended.

---

## 8. What is the **static** keyword? (Field, Method, Class) When do we use it?

**Answer:**
- **Field**: Shared among all objects of a class.
- **Method**: Belongs to the class rather than any specific instance.
- **Class**: The keyword cannot be applied to classes, but static inner classes are allowed.

When to use it?
- Use it for constants, utility methods, and shared resources.

## 9. What are the differences between **Overriding** and **Overloading**?

**Answer:**

| Feature            | **Overriding**                          | **Overloading**                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Redefining a method in a subclass.     | Methods with the same name but different parameters. |
| **coding1.Inheritance**    | Requires inheritance.                  | Can occur in the same class.         |
| **Return Type**    | Must be the same or covariant.         | Can have different return types.     |

## 10. What is the difference between **super** and **this**?

**Answer:**
- **`this`**: Refers to the current instance of the class.
- **`super`**: Refers to the immediate parent class instance.

---

## 11. What is the Java **Load Sequence**?

**Answer:**  
The sequence in which Java loads classes and initializes variables:
1. Static block and static variables are executed first (in the order they appear).
2. Instance variables and instance blocks execute after the constructor call.

---

## 12. What is **coding1.Polymorphism** and how does Java implement it?

**Answer:**  
coding1.Polymorphism allows an object to take on many forms.
- Java implements it using **method overriding** (runtime polymorphism) and **method overloading** (compile-time polymorphism).

---

## 13. What is **coding1.Encapsulation**? How does Java implement it? Why do we need it?

**Answer:**  
coding1.Encapsulation is bundling data (fields) and methods in a single unit (class) and restricting direct access.

### Implementation:
- Use `private` access modifiers for fields.
- Use getters and setters to control field access.

### Why do we need it?
- Protects data integrity.
- Hides implementation details from the user.

## 14. What is an **Interface** and what is an **abstract class**? What are the differences between them?

**Answer:**

| Feature                | **Interface**                     | **Abstract Class**              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Methods**            | Only abstract methods (Java 7).   | Can have abstract and concrete methods. |
| **Fields**             | Only `static` and `final`.        | Can have instance variables.    |
| **coding1.Inheritance**        | Multiple inheritance is allowed.  | Only single inheritance.        |
| **Default Methods**    | Supported since Java 8.           | Not applicable.                 |
| **Use Case**           | Defines behavior (contract).      | Provides partial implementation. |

## 16. What are Queue interface implementations and what are the differences and when to use what?

**Answer:**  

| **Implementation**       | **Description**                                                   | **When to Use**                                      |

| **LinkedList**           | Implements a queue using a linked list (FIFO).                   | Use when frequent insertion and deletion is needed. |
| **PriorityQueue**        | Orders elements based on their natural ordering or comparator.   | Use when priority-based processing is required.     |
| **ArrayDeque**           | Implements a double-ended queue using a resizable array.         | Use for both stack and queue operations.            |
| **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**| Thread-safe, non-blocking implementation of a FIFO queue.        | Use for concurrent access in multi-threading.       |
| **BlockingQueue**        | Extends Queue; supports operations that wait for the queue to grow/shrink. | Use in producer-consumer scenarios.                |
