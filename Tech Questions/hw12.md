### 2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?
Bean A depends on Bean B and Bean B depends on Bean A.
```java
@Component
public class BeanA {
    private final BeanB beanB;
    @Autowired
    public BeanA(BeanB beanB) {
        this.beanB = beanB;
    }
    public String showMessage() {
        return "A uses: " + beanB.showMessage();
    }
}

@Component
public class BeanB {
    private final BeanA beanA;
    @Autowired
    public BeanB(BeanA beanA) {
        this.beanA = beanA;
    }
    public String showMessage() {
        return "B uses: " + beanA.showMessage();
    }
}
```

### 3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
- Tight Coupling: two classes or components are highly dependent on each other, making it difficult to change one without affecting the other.
- Loose Coupling: two classes or components are independent, allowing changes in one without affecting the other.
- IOC (Inversion of Control) in Spring allows for loose coupling by managing the dependencies between components, making it easier to change and maintain the code.

### 4. What is MVC pattern>

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used for developing web applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components:
  - Model: represents the data and business logic.
  - View: represents the UI and presentation layer.
  - Controller: handles user input and interacts with the model to update the view.

### 5. What is Front-Controller?

The front controller maps the incoming requests to a controller.

### 6. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of dispatcherServlet in your IDE

DispatcherServlet is a core component of the Spring MVC framework. It acts as a front controller that handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler methods. The DispatcherServlet is configured in the web.xml file or through Java configuration.  
To find the DispatcherServlet in the IDE, look for the `web.xml` file or the Java configuration class where it is defined.

### 7. What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ
- JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web content using HTML and Java code.
- ModelAndView is a Spring class that holds both the model data and the view name to be rendered.

### 8. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat

- Servlet is a small java program that runs within a web server, and receives and responds from web clients.
- Servlet container is a server that manages the lifecycle of servlets and routes requests to them.
- Some servlet implementations: Apache Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish.
