### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.
- IoC:```@Component```、```@Configuration```、```@Bean```、```@ComponentScan```
- DI:```@Autowired```、```@Qualifier```、```@Resource```、```@Value```
- MVC:```@Controller```、```@RestController```、```@RequestMapping```、```@GetMapping```、```@PathVariable```、```@RequestParam```、```@RequestBody```、```@ResponseBody```

### 2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?
- In a circular dependency scenario, two or more beans depend on each other. In the simplest case, Bean A depends on Bean B, while Bean B also depends on Bean A. This can lead to problems when Spring tries to create and inject these beans at runtime, especially if you are using constructor injection on both sides.
```
@Service
public class AService {
    private final BService bService;

    // Constructor injection
    @Autowired
    public AService(BService bService) {
        this.bService = bService;
    }

    public String doSomethingA() {
        return "A is using " + bService.doSomethingB();
    }
}
```
```
@Service
public class BService {
    private final AService aService;

    // Constructor injection
    @Autowired
    public BService(AService aService) {
        this.aService = aService;
    }

    public String doSomethingB() {
        return "B is using " + aService.doSomethingA();
    }
}
```
### 3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
- Tight coupling means two classes or components are highly dependent on each other.
- Loose coupling means classes or components communicate through interfaces or abstractions, and don’t instantiate each other directly.
- IoC (Inversion of Control) means instead of your classes creating their own dependencies, a container (in this case, the Spring framework) is responsible for creating objects and wiring them together.
### 4. What is MVC pattern?
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application's logic into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller.
### 5. What is Front-Controller?
- A front controller is a web application component that handles incoming user requests and routes them to the appropriate page.
### 6. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of dispatcherServlet in your IDE (Jetbrain IntelliJIdea)
- DispatcherServlet is the front controller in the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. It intercepts and routes all HTTP requests to the appropriate Controller for processing, and then it selects the appropriate View (or response) to render the result.
- Search for the Class in External Libraries
- Use IntelliJ’s "Navigate to Class" (or "Find in Path")
- Check Auto-Configuration Reports (Spring Boot)
### 7. What is JSP and What is Model And View？
- JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology in the Java ecosystem used to create dynamic web content (e.g., HTML pages).
- ModelAndView is a Spring MVC class that represents both the model data and the view to be rendered when a controller method finishes processing a request.
### 8. Explain servlet and servlet container , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat
- A Servlet is a Java-based server-side component that follows the Servlet API (originally part of Java EE, now under the Jakarta EE umbrella).
- Some containers like Jetty or Tomcat are often called “web servers” or “servlet containers,” while larger offerings like GlassFish, WildFly, or WebSphere are referred to as full application servers
### 9. clone this repo, and run it on you local,
#### 1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
#### 2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.
#### 3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
#### 4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project
#### 5. Test APIs (controllers) in postman
