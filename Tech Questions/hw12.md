# HW12
## Questions:

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md (your own cheatsheet).
Check annotations.md

### 2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code. How do we resolve it?
Circular dependencies scenario happens when multiple beans depend on each other.

```
@Component
public class BeanA {
    @Autowired
    private BeanB beanB;
}

@Component
public class BeanB {
    @Autowired
    private BeanA beanA;
}
```
BeanA and BeanB depend on the injection on each other. It can be solved by adding `@Lazy` on one of the bean to delay the initialization. Then use setter injection like
```
@Autowired
    public void setBeanB(BeanB beanB) {
        this.beanB = beanB;
    }
```

### 3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
Tight coupling: Classes are dependent on each other's implementation.

Loose coupling: Classes depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead of their implementations.
```
public class Service {
    private final Repository repository;

    public Service(Repository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}
```
Service class depend on an interface (can work with any `Repository` implementation).
Spring IOC enables loose coupling because dependencies are injected by the framework (Spring Container)

### 4. What is MVC pattern?
MVC pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:
Model: Manages the data and business logic (e.g., database entity).
View: Displays the data (e.g., HTML, JSP, or frontend views).
Controller: Handles user input and interactions, communicates between the Model and View.


### 5. What is Front-Controller?
It's a single entry point for all HTTP requests
`DispatcherServlet` as a front-controller in Spring. It receives all incoming HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers (controllers) for processing.

### 6. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of DispatcherServlet in your IDE (JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA).
DispatcherServlet is the central servlet that receives and handles all HTTP requests in Spring MVC. Then it will process the response like render views or return JSON response.
It located at ~/.../org/springframework/spring-webmvc/6.2.1/spring-webmvc-6.2.1.jar!/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.class

### 7. What is JSP and what is Model And View?
JSP is used to create dynamic web pages, which can embed Java code into HTML.
Model represents the data (entities or DTO). View represents the display layer like JSP or HTML.

### 8. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat.
servlet is a Java class running on a web server to handle HTTP requests and responses.

servlet container is a runtime environment that manages servlets with network applications and lifecycle management. E.g. Jetty, JBoss, GlassFish
