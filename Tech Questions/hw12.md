\2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?  

```java
@Component
class A {
    @Autowired
    private B b;
}

@Component
class B {
    @Autowired
    private A a;
}

//Use @Lazy on one of the dependencies.
@Component
class A {
    private final B b;
    @Autowired
    public A(@Lazy B b) { this.b = b; }
}

//Refactor to break the dependency (e.g., using interfaces or events).
//Use @PostConstruct to initialize after dependency injection.
```

\3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?  

```java
//Tight Coupling: Objects are dependent on specific implementations (classes), making changes difficult.
//Loose Coupling: Objects depend on abstractions (interfaces), improving flexibility.
//Spring IoC injects dependencies dynamically, promoting loose coupling.

interface Vehicle { 
    void move(); 
}
@Component
class Car implements Vehicle { 
    public void move() { 
        System.out.println("Car is moving"); 
    } 
}

@Component
class Driver {
    private final Vehicle vehicle;
    @Autowired
    public Driver(Vehicle vehicle) { 
        this.vehicle = vehicle; 
    }
}
```

\4. What is MVC pattern?  

```
Model: Represents business logic & data (Service, DAO).
View: UI representation (JSP).
Controller: Handles requests & binds Model and View (@Controller).
```

\5. What is Front-Controller?  

```
Like DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC, it is a centralized entry point that handles all requests, processes them, and delegates tasks to appropriate handlers.
```

\6. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of dispatcherServlet in your
IDE  

```java
Intercepts all requests; Finds appropriate Controller; Processes request and returns a ModelAndView; Resolves the view and renders the response.
```

\7. What is JSP and What is Model And Viewï¼Ÿ  

```
JSP (JavaServer Pages): A view technology to render dynamic HTML content.
ModelAndView: A Spring MVC object that holds both Model data and View name.
```

\8. Explain servlet and servlet container , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers
other than tomcat  

```
Servlet: A Java class that handles HTTP requests (doGet(), doPost()).
Servlet Container: Manages servlets (loading, execution, lifecycle).

Servlet Implementations: Jetty, Undertow
Servlet Containers: WildFly, JBoss, WebSphere, GlassFish
```
