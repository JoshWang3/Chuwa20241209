# Homework 12
## Spring MVC 

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.
- see annotations.md

### 2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?
- A circular dependency occurs when two or more components in an application depend on each other, either directly or indirectly, forming a cycle. For example: Component A depends on Component B. Component B depends on Component A. In dependency injection, this leads to issues because the DI container tries to resolve dependencies recursively and ends up in an infinite loop.

We can break the cycle by injecting one of the dependencies lazily using `@Lazy` annotation. It ensures that the dependency is not resolved until it is actually needed, breaking the cycle. We can break the cycle by using setter injection instead of constructor injection. This allows Spring to initialize the beans without requiring both dependencies at construction time. Moreover, we can refactor by introducing an intermediary service or interface to decouple the components.

### 3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
- In tight coupling, components are heavily dependent on one another. If one component changes, it often requires changes in other related components. Components are directly aware of each other, and therefore hard to test individual components. This is because, without Dependency Injection, objects need to create their dependencies directly.

- In loose coupling, components depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, making them easier to replace or modify. Components are independent and communicate through abstractions, and therefore easy to test and maintain. With Dependency Injection, objects receive their dependencies from an external source.

- Spring's IOC container is a powerful mechanism that facilitates loose coupling by managing the lifecycle and dependencies of application objects (beans). 
1. The IoC container injects dependencies into components, reducing the need for them to create their own dependencies.
2. The container creates, initializes, and destroys beans as required, managing their lifecycle automatically.
3.  Dependencies and configurations are centralized using XML, Java-based configuration (`@Configuration`), or annotations (`@Component`, `@Autowired`).
4. The IoC container abstracts the process of object creation, allowing us to focus on business logic rather than wiring dependencies.
5.  IoC works seamlessly with Springâ€™s AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.

### 4. What is MVC pattern?
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a widely used architectural pattern for building user interfaces. It separates an application into three interconnected components, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable

### 5. What is Front-Controller?
- The Front Controller is a design pattern commonly used in web application development. It centralizes the handling of requests by directing all incoming requests to a single handler, which then dispatches them to appropriate components for processing. This pattern is widely used in frameworks like Spring MVC, Struts, and ASP.NET MVC.

### 6. Explain Dispatcherservlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of dispatcherservlet in your IDE (Jetbrain Intellijidea)
- The DispatcherServlet is a core component of the Spring MVC framework. It acts as the Front Controller, responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests, delegating the requests to appropriate controllers, and managing the lifecycle of a request from start to finish.

### 7. What is JSP and What is Model And View?
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a server-side technology in Java that allows developers to create dynamic web pages. It combines HTML, XML, or other document types with embedded Java code to produce interactive content. JSP allows embedding Java code directly into HTML using special tags (<% %>). It supports the MVC pattern by acting as the View in the application. JSP files are compiled into servlets by the web container (e.g., Tomcat) during execution.

- ModelAndView is a Spring MVC class used to encapsulate both Model and View. Model is the data required by the view for rendering, while View is the logical name of the view to be rendered. It separates business logic (Model) from presentation (View), and enables easy integration of data and view resolution.

### 8. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat

- Servlet is a Java program that runs on a web server and is used to handle client requests and generate dynamic web content. Servlets are part of the Java Servlet API, which is a key component of the Java EE (Jakarta EE) platform. The servlet is initialized by the container when first loaded. Then, the servlet processes incoming requests and generates responses. Finally, the servlet is destroyed when the container shuts down or the servlet is removed.

- Servlet Container is a part of a web server or application server that provides the runtime environment for servlets. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping URLs to servlets, and ensuring secure and efficient execution. Servlet implementations are libraries that adhere to the Java Servlet API, for example, Apache Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish, WildFly, and Payara Server etc.

### 9. clone this repo, and run it on you local,
#### 1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
#### 2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.
#### 3. find out the APls in controlelr and call some APis, In slides, I also list some API.
#### 4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project
#### 5. Test APls (controllers) in postman
