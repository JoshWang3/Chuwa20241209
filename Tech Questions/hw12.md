## Question 1

**List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.**

---

## Question 2

**Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?**

### Explanation:
Circular dependency occurs when two or more beans are dependent on each other, creating a loop. This can cause runtime errors in Spring during bean initialization.

### Resolution:
1. Use `@Lazy` annotation to delay the initialization of one of the beans.
2. Use constructor injection sparingly and switch to setter injection or `@PostConstruct` initialization.

### Example Code:
```java
@Component
class A {
    private final B b;

    public A(@Lazy B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

@Component
class B {
    private final A a;

    public B(@Lazy A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
```

## Question 3

**Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IoC do?**

### Explanation:
- **Tight Coupling:** When classes are directly dependent on one another, changes in one class often require changes in the other.
- **Loose Coupling:** Classes interact via interfaces or abstractions, reducing interdependence.

### Role of Spring IoC:
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) uses dependency injection to promote loose coupling by managing the object lifecycle and dependencies through configuration.

## Question 4

**What is the MVC pattern?**

### Explanation:
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller:
- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:** Represents the presentation layer.
- **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the Model and View.

## Question 5

**What is Front-Controller?**

### Explanation:
The Front Controller is a design pattern used in web applications where a single controller handles all incoming requests. In Spring MVC, the `DispatcherServlet` acts as the front controller.

---

## Question 6

**Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of DispatcherServlet in your IDE (Jetbrain IntelliJIdea).**

### Explanation:
- **DispatcherServlet** is the central component of Spring MVC, responsible for handling all HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate controllers.
- It works by:
    1. Receiving the HTTP request.
    2. Mapping the request to a controller using the HandlerMapping.
    3. Executing the business logic and rendering a view.

### Demonstration:
In IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Locate `web.xml` or Spring Boot `@SpringBootApplication` file.
2. Verify `DispatcherServlet` is initialized as the front controller.

---

## Question 7

**What is JSP and what is Model And View?**

### Explanation:
- **JSP (Java Server Pages):** A technology to create dynamic web content by embedding Java code in HTML pages.
- **Model And View:** A Spring MVC component that holds the model data and the view name to be rendered.

---

## Question 8

**Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than Tomcat.**

### Explanation:
- **Servlet:** A Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Servlet Container:** A runtime environment for managing and executing servlets (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish).

### Other Servlet Containers:
- Jetty
- GlassFish
- JBoss/WildFly
