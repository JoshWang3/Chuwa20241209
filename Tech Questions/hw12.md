2. 
   1. Circular dependency occurs when two or more beans are interdependent.
   2. To resolve it:
     Use @Lazy annotation to delay initialization.
     Refactor the code to break the dependency chain.
     Use setter injection instead of constructor injection.
3.  
    1. Tight Coupling: Classes are highly dependent on each other. Changes in one class require changes in others. 
    2. Loose Coupling: Classes interact through interfaces or abstractions. Changes in one class have minimal impact. 
    3. Spring IoC: It promotes loose coupling by managing object creation and their dependencies through Dependency Injection.
4. A design pattern for separating concerns in applications
5. The Front-Controller is a design pattern where a single point handles all incoming requests. In Spring MVC, the DispatcherServlet acts as the front-controller.
6. DispatcherServlet is the core of Spring MVC. It intercepts incoming requests, maps them to the appropriate controllers, and returns responses.
   1. Intercepts requests. 
   2. Determines the handler (controller). 
   3. Passes requests to the controller. 
   4. Returns the response to the client.
7. A technology for creating dynamic web pages on the server side.
   1. Model: Represents data. 
   2. View: Represents the UI displayed to users.
8. 
   1. Servlet: A Java class that handles HTTP requests and generates responses. 
   2. Servlet Container: Manages servlets, handles requests, and provides runtime support.
