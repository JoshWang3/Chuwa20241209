### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.

- IoC:`@Component`、`@Configuration`、`@Bean`、`@ComponentScan`
- DI:`@Autowired`、`@Qualifier`、`@Resource`、`@Value`
- MVC:`@Controller`、`@RestController`、`@RequestMapping`、`@GetMapping`、`@PathVariable`、`@RequestParam`、`@RequestBody`、`@ResponseBody`

### 2. Explain circular dependencies scenario in dependency injection with your code, how do we resolve it?

---

### What is a Circular Dependency?

A circular dependency happens when two or more beans depend on each other, directly or indirectly, creating a loop.

---

### Example of Circular Dependency:

```java
@Component
public class A {
    @Autowired
    private B b;
}

@Component
public class B {
    @Autowired
    private A a;
}
```

Spring will throw a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` during startup because it cannot resolve the circular reference.

---

### How to Resolve It?

#### 1. Use Constructor Injection with `@Lazy` on one side:

```java
@Component
public class A {
    private final B b;

    public A(@Lazy B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Refactor to remove the cycle:

- Extract shared logic into a third class (e.g., class `C`) and inject that into both `A` and `B`.

#### 3. Use Setter Injection:

```java
@Component
public class A {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public void setB(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?

---

### Tight Coupling:

- Classes are directly dependent on specific implementations.
- Hard to change, extend, or test.

```java
public class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // tightly coupled
}
```

---

### Loose Coupling:

- Classes depend on **abstractions**, not concrete implementations.
- Easier to maintain, test, and reuse.

```java
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine; // loosely coupled
    }
}
```

---

### What Does Spring IoC Do?

- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** means Spring creates and injects dependencies for you.
- Helps achieve **loose coupling** using **Dependency Injection**.
- You write interfaces, and Spring wires the implementation at runtime.

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. What is MVC pattern?

**MVC** stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It is a design pattern used to separate concerns in web applications.

---

### Components:

1. **Model**

   - Represents the data and business logic.
   - Example: Entity classes, services, repositories.

2. **View**

   - Represents the UI or response.
   - Example: HTML pages (Thymeleaf), JSON responses.

3. **Controller**
   - Handles user input (e.g., HTTP requests), processes it via the model, and returns the view.

---

### 5. What is Front-Controller?

A **Front Controller** is a design pattern where a **single handler** (controller) is responsible for processing **all incoming requests** and routing them to the appropriate components.

---

### In Spring MVC:

- The front controller is `DispatcherServlet`.
- It receives every HTTP request and:
  1. Delegates it to the correct controller
  2. Executes the controller logic
  3. Returns the view or response

---

### Benefits:

- Centralized request handling
- Easy to apply common logic (logging, security, error handling)
- Simplifies routing

---

### 6. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works, demonstrate the existence of dispatcherServlet in your IDE (Jetbrain IntelliJIdea)

---

### What is `DispatcherServlet`?

- `DispatcherServlet` is the **front controller** in Spring MVC.
- It handles **all HTTP requests** and delegates them to the appropriate handler methods (controllers).
- It is automatically registered when you use `spring-boot-starter-web`.

---

### How `DispatcherServlet` Works:

1. **Receives request** from the client.
2. **Finds the matching controller** using handler mappings.
3. **Calls the controller method** to handle the request.
4. **Resolves a view** (HTML, JSON, etc.).
5. **Returns response** to the client.

---

### Internals:

- DispatcherServlet is a subclass of `HttpServlet`.
- Configured automatically via Spring Boot (`@SpringBootApplication` + `spring-boot-starter-web`).

---

### How to See `DispatcherServlet` in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open the `External Libraries` section in the project.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   org.springframework:spring-web:... → org.springframework.web.servlet → DispatcherServlet.class
   ```
3. You can Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click on `DispatcherServlet` in your code (e.g., from a stack trace) to go to the source.

---

### 7. What is JSP and What is Model And View？

---

### What is JSP?

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** is a server-side view technology used to create dynamic HTML pages using Java.
- It allows embedding Java code inside HTML using special tags like `<% %>`, `${}`, etc.
- Used in traditional Java web apps (not common in modern Spring Boot).

---

### What is Model and View?

- **Model**: Holds the application data (usually passed from the controller to the view).
- **View**: Represents the UI (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).

---

### 8. Explain servlet and servlet container , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat

### What is a Servlet?

- A **Servlet** is a Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses.
- It runs on the server and follows the Servlet API (`javax.servlet` or `jakarta.servlet`).

---

### What is a Servlet Container?

- A **Servlet Container** (also called a Web Container) is part of a web server that:

  - Manages the lifecycle of servlets
  - Maps URLs to servlets
  - Handles request/response routing

- It implements the **Servlet specification**.

### 9. clone this repo, and run it on you local,

#### 1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo

#### 2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.

#### 3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.

#### 4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project

#### 5. Test APIs (controllers) in postman
