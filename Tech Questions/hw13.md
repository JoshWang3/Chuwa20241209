   1. TLS: A protocol ensuring secure communication over a network. It encrypts data to protect it during transmission. 
   2. PKI: A framework for managing digital certificates and public-private key pairs to enable secure communication. 
   3. Certificate: A digital document issued by a Certificate Authority to prove ownership of a public key. 
   4. Public Key: Part of the key pair used in encryption; shared publicly to encrypt data or verify a signature. 
   5. Private Key: Kept secret, used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key or sign data to ensure authenticity. 
   6. Signature: A cryptographic assurance generated using a private key to confirm the integrity and origin of data.
4. 401, 403
5. 
   1. Authentication: Verifying the user's identity.
   2. Authorization: Determining what resources an authenticated user can access.
6. Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or visit to a Web site and to store information about that user
7. Cookies are small text files stored on the client side by a browser.
8. 
   1. Session: Server-side storage for user-specific data.
   2. Cookie: Client-side storage, shared with each HTTP request.
9.
   1. User sign in with google
   2. redirects to google server for authentication
   3. google returns authorization token to the application
10. 
    1. Session: Stores user data on the server, with session IDs sent to the client via cookies. 
    2. Cookie: Stores lightweight user information like preferences or a session ID, enabling the server to retrieve relevant data for the user.
11. A chain of filters that intercepts requests, performing actions like authentication, authorization, and CSRF checks before forwarding the request.
12. 
    1. Bearer Token: A token included in the HTTP Authorization header to grant access to protected resources. 
    2. JWT: A compact, self-contained token with header, payload, signature.
13. Use secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for passwords. Store only the hash, never the plaintext password.
14. 
    1. UserDetailsService: Provides user details during authentication. 
    2. AuthenticationProvider: Validates credentials and returns an Authentication object. 
    3. AuthenticationManager: Delegates authentication tasks to the appropriate provider. 
    4. AuthenticationFilter: Intercepts HTTP requests to trigger the authentication process.
15. 
    1. Disadvantages: Server-side storage limits scalability. Dependency on server memory. 
    2. Solutions: Use stateless mechanisms like JWT for scalability. Employ distributed session storage (e.g., Redis).
16. Use the @Value annotation or Environment object.
17. 
    1. configure(HttpSecurity http): Configures HTTP security, such as specifying endpoints, CSRF, CORS, and authorization rules. 
    2. configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures how authentication is handled, such as setting a custom UserDetailsService or password encoder.
