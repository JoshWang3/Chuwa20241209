### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

### 2. Explain TLS, PKI, certificate, public key, private key, and signature.
- **TLS:**
- A security protocol that enables encrypted communication over the internet, ensuring privacy and integrity of data transmitted between two parties.
- **PKI:**
- A system that manages the issuance and verification of digital certificates, which contain public keys and identify the owner of that key.
- **Certificate:**
- A digital document that acts as proof of identity, containing information like the owner's name, public key, and a digital signature from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Public Key:**
- A cryptographic key that can be freely distributed and used to encrypt data, meaning only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt it.
- **Private Key:**
- A cryptographic key that must be kept secret and is used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key.
- **Signature:**
- A digital signature created using a private key that verifies the authenticity of a message or document, ensuring it was sent by the claimed sender.
### 3. Write a Spring security based application, which provides https APIs (one simple get controller with empty response is good enough )instead of http, please generate a self-signed certificate to make your https TLS verfication work.

### 1. Pack your self-signed certificate in the form of jks file, as part of your application, name it properly

### 2. Test if you can verify your HTTPs api without importing the self-signed certificate to your local certificate chain, if not, explain why.
- No. By default, a self-signed certificate will fail validation checks unless the certificate (or its CA) is explicitly trusted.
- A self-signed certificate is one where the issuing CA and the server certificate are effectively the same entity. Since no known (public) CA signed it, there’s no recognized “chain of trust”. Out of the box, operating systems or browsers will not trust your self-signed certificate. As a result, any standard HTTPS validation flow will fail.
### 3. Explain what did you do to make https call work, do NOT bypass TLS/SSL verfication in Postman (this is cheating)!
####   Tutorial: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-channel-security-https
- Import the certificate into Postman’s Certificate
- Match the Host
- Keep Postman’s SSL verification ON
### 4. list all http status codes that related to authentication and authorization failures.
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 407 Proxy Authentication Required
- 511 Network Authentication Required
- 419 Authentication Timeout
- 440 Login Timeout
### 5. Compare authentication and authorization? Name and explain important components in Spring security that undertake authentication and authorization
- **Authentication:**
- Verifying the identity of a user or service.
- AuthenticationManager:
- The core interface for authentication, responsible for validating user credentials.
- AuthenticationProvider:
- An implementation of AuthenticationManager that handles a specific authentication mechanism (e.g., DaoAuthenticationProvider for database-backed authentication).
- UserDetailsService:
- Loads user details from a data source (e.g., a database) to be used during authentication.
- PasswordEncoder:
- Encodes and verifies passwords securely.
- UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter:
- Extracts username and password from the request and initiates the authentication process.

- **Authorization:**
- Determining what a user or service is allowed to do after authentication.
- AccessDecisionManager: Decides if a user is allowed to access a resource based on the provided Authentication object and access rules.
- GrantedAuthority: Represents a user's permission or role.
- SecurityContextHolder: Holds the current Authentication object, representing the authenticated user.
- FilterChainProxy: The entry point for all requests, delegating to various filters for authentication and authorization.
- @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, @Secured: Annotations used to define access control rules for methods.
RoleVoter, AuthenticatedVoter: Voters used by AccessDecisionManager to check if the user has the required roles or is authenticated.
### 6. Explain HTTP Session?
- An HTTP session is a way for a web server to store and identify a user across multiple requests to a website.
### 7. Explain Cookie?
- A cookie is a small piece of data that a website sends to a user's browser
### 8. Compare Session and Cookie?
- Sessions are stored on the server and are more secure but temporary, while cookies are stored on the user’s computer and can last longer but are less secure. Choosing between them depends on the need for security and persistence of the data.
### 9. Find at least TWO websites who can be logged in using your Google Account, explain in detail on how Google SSO works with screenshots like below, find SSO-related Rest calls in Chrome developer tool:
- Click “Sign in with Google,”
- Redirect to accounts.google.com,
- Authenticate & consent,
- Google returns auth code,
- Website exchanges code for tokens.
### 10. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
- They allow an application to “remember” and authenticate users across multiple requests by letting the server match incoming requests to a persistent user session.
### 11. What is the spring security filter?
- In Spring Security, a filter is a component that intercepts and processes incoming HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses.
### 12. Explain bearer token and how JWT works.
- A Bearer token is an access token that grants access to protected resources simply by being present in an Authorization header.
- JWT (JSON Web Token) is a popular type of Bearer token that encodes user info (claims) in a signed (and optionally encrypted) JSON.
### 13. Explain how do we store sensitive user information such as password and credit card number in DB?
    1. Storing Passwords
        Hashing and Salting Passwords
            - Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that converts the password into a fixed-length string of characters (the hash). Hashing makes it nearly impossible to recover the original password from the hash.
            - Salting involves adding a unique random value (a "salt") to each password before hashing. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to reverse the hash.
        Steps to Securely Store Passwords:
            - Choose a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2). These functions are designed to be slow, which makes brute-force attacks harder.
            - Generate a unique salt for each password. The salt should be long and random. Many modern password hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt, handle salting internally, so you don’t need to manually add the salt.
            - Hash the password with the salt using the chosen hashing algorithm. The result will be a unique hash for each password, even if two users have the same password.
            - Store the salt and hash in the database. Ensure the salt and hash are securely stored (in separate columns, for example).
```java
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Base64;

public class SaltedPasswordStorage {

    // Method to generate a random salt
    private static byte[] generateSalt() throws Exception {
        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[16]; // Salt length is 16 bytes
        secureRandom.nextBytes(salt);
        return salt;
    }

    // Method to hash the password with salt
    private static String hashPasswordWithSalt(String password, byte[] salt) throws Exception {
        MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256"); // Use SHA-256 for hashing
        messageDigest.update(salt); // Apply the salt
        byte[] hashedPassword = messageDigest.digest(password.getBytes()); // Hash the password with the salt
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hashedPassword); // Convert to Base64 string for storage
    }

    // Main method to demonstrate storing a salted password
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String password = "mySuperSecretPassword"; // The user's plain password

        // Step 1: Generate a random salt
        byte[] salt = generateSalt();

        // Step 2: Hash the password with the salt
        String hashedPassword = hashPasswordWithSalt(password, salt);

        // Step 3: Store the salt and hashed password (we'll print them here for demonstration)
        System.out.println("Salt (Base64): " + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(salt));
        System.out.println("Hashed Password (Base64): " + hashedPassword);

        // Step 4: In a real application, store the salt and hashed password in the database
    }
}
```
    2. Storing Credit Card
        Steps to Securely Store Credit Card Numbers:
        - Encrypt the Credit Card Data:
            Use strong encryption to protect credit card numbers. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key length of at least 256 bits is recommended for encrypting sensitive data at rest.
            Always use secure key management to manage encryption keys. This ensures that the keys are protected and not stored alongside the encrypted data.
        - Tokenization:
            Instead of storing the full credit card number, consider using tokenization, which replaces the actual credit card number with a token. The token can be used for transactions but has no value outside the system.
            Tokenization reduces the scope of PCI DSS compliance, as the token is useless without access to the tokenization system.
        - Limit Access to Sensitive Data:
            Restrict access to credit card information based on user roles and use access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
            Only allow access to encrypted credit card data when it's necessary (e.g., during a payment transaction).
        - Use a Secure Payment Gateway:
            It's often recommended to use a trusted third-party payment gateway to handle credit card transactions. This way, your application doesn't need to store or process sensitive card information directly, reducing the security risks.
```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import java.util.Base64;

public class CreditCardEncryptionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String creditCardNumber = "1234-5678-9876-5432";

        // Generate AES key
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGenerator.init(256); // 256-bit AES key
        SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();

        // Encrypt the credit card number
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
        byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(creditCardNumber.getBytes());

        // Convert the encrypted bytes to Base64 to store in the database
        String encryptedCreditCard = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes);
        System.out.println("Encrypted Credit Card: " + encryptedCreditCard);
    }
}
```
### 14. Compare UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
    1. UserDetailsService
        Role: The primary interface for loading user-specific data during the authentication process.
        Purpose: It is responsible for retrieving user details from a data source (e.g., a database or LDAP). The UserDetailsService interface is typically implemented to retrieve a user's information (like username, password, roles) and return a UserDetails object.
        Main Methods:
            loadUserByUsername(String username): This method is used to fetch user details based on the provided username. It is called by AuthenticationManager during authentication.
        Usage: Typically, a custom implementation of UserDetailsService will interact with a database or an external service to load the user's information.
```java
@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user == null) {
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found");
        }
        return new User(user.getUsername(), user.getPassword(), new ArrayList<>());
    }
}
```
    2. AuthenticationProvider
        Role: Used for authenticating a user by validating the provided credentials.
        Purpose: An AuthenticationProvider is responsible for validating the user’s credentials (like username and password) during authentication. It can be configured to work with multiple authentication mechanisms, such as in-memory authentication, database authentication, or LDAP authentication.
        Main Methods:
            authenticate(Authentication authentication): This method is used to perform the actual authentication. It checks the validity of the credentials (e.g., password matching, role checking).
            supports(Class<?> authentication): This method is used to check if the provider supports the type of authentication being passed.
        Usage: Spring Security typically uses AuthenticationProvider to authenticate users against a data store (like a database). If you need custom authentication logic (e.g., validating credentials using a third-party service), you can create a custom implementation of AuthenticationProvider.
```java
@Component
public class CustomAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {

    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @Override
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
        String username = authentication.getName();
        String password = (String) authentication.getCredentials();

        UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);

        // Validate password (can add custom logic here)
        if (!password.equals(userDetails.getPassword())) {
            throw new BadCredentialsException("Invalid credentials");
        }

        // Return the authenticated token
        return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, password, userDetails.getAuthorities());
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> authentication) {
        return UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFrom(authentication);
    }
}
```
    3. AuthenticationManager
        Role: The central component that coordinates the authentication process.
        Purpose: 
            AuthenticationManager is responsible for managing the authentication logic. 
            It typically delegates the actual authentication process to an AuthenticationProvider to check the validity of credentials. 
            It’s the main interface for authenticating users.
        Main Methods:
            authenticate(Authentication authentication): This method attempts to authenticate the user by calling the authenticate method of the AuthenticationProvider(s).
        Usage: AuthenticationManager is configured in the SecurityConfig class and used by AuthenticationFilter (or similar filters) to authenticate users during HTTP requests. It can delegate authentication to multiple AuthenticationProvider beans.
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.authenticationProvider(new CustomAuthenticationProvider());
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```
    4. AuthenticationFilter
        Role: A filter that intercepts HTTP requests and triggers authentication.
        Purpose: 
            The AuthenticationFilter (e.g., UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter) is responsible for intercepting HTTP requests and performing authentication 
            when a user attempts to log in. It takes the credentials (username and password) from the request (typically from a form or token), 
            and passes them to the AuthenticationManager for validation.
        Main Methods:
            doFilter(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain): This method intercepts the request, extracts credentials, and initiates authentication using AuthenticationManager. It also proceeds with the request chain after authentication is complete.
        Usage: You can configure AuthenticationFilter in your Spring Security configuration to intercept authentication requests, like form submissions, and authenticate the user.
```java
public class CustomAuthenticationFilter extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter {

    @Override
    public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws AuthenticationException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");

        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authRequest = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
        return getAuthenticationManager().authenticate(authRequest);
    }
}
```
### 15. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
- It can negatively impact performance, especially when dealing with large amounts of user data
- Minimize session data
- Use a distributed session store
- Implement token-based authentication
- Optimize session timeout
- Use a hybrid approach
### 16. how to get value from application.properties in Spring security?
- Using the @Value annotation
- Using @ConfigurationProperties
### 17. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- configure(HttpSecurity http): Defines which requests need authentication, access rules, login/logout pages, CSRF, session management, and other HTTP-level security concerns.
- configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Sets up how users are authenticated (e.g., in memory, JDBC, LDAP) and configures password encoders or custom authentication providers.
