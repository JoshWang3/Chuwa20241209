| **419**     | Authentication Timeout *(Non-Standard)* | Authentication has timed out (commonly used in some frameworks).   |
| **440**     | Login Timeout *(Microsoft-specific)* | The user's session has expired and they need to log in again.      |
| **451**     | Unavailable For Legal Reasons | Access to the resource is denied for legal reasons.                |

*Note: Codes 419 and 440 are non-standard and may not be supported universally.*

## 5. Compare authentication and authorization? Name and explain important components in Spring security that undertake authentication and authorization.

**Authentication** and **Authorization** are two distinct but related concepts in security.

| Aspect           | Authentication                                    | Authorization                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Verifying the identity of a user or entity.       | Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. |
| **Purpose**      | To ensure that users are who they claim to be.     | To control access to resources based on permissions. |
| **Process**      | Involves credentials like usernames and passwords.| Involves permissions, roles, and access rights.     |
| **Example**      | Logging in with a username and password.           | Accessing a restricted page or performing an action. |

## 6. Explain HTTP Session?

An **HTTP Session** manages stateful interactions between a client and server over the inherently stateless HTTP protocol.

- Key Concepts

    - **Session ID**
    - A unique identifier assigned to a user's session.
    - Typically stored in a cookie or passed via URL parameters.

    - **State Management**
    - Maintains user-specific data (e.g., login status, preferences) across multiple requests.

    - **Server-Side Storage**
    - Session data is stored on the server, linked to the Session ID.
    - Can be stored in memory, databases, or distributed caches.

    - **Lifecycle**
    - **Creation**: Initiated when a user starts interacting with the application.
    - **Maintenance**: Continues as long as the session is active, based on activity or timeouts.
    - **Termination**: Ends upon logout, expiration, or server invalidation.

- Use Cases

    - **Authentication**
    - Keeping users logged in across different pages.

## 8. Compare Session and Cookie?

| **Aspect**           | **Session**                                                                 | **Cookie**                                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Server-side storage of user data to manage stateful interactions.          | Client-side storage of small data pieces in the browser.              |
| **Storage Location** | Stored on the server.                                                       | Stored on the client's browser.                                        |
| **Data Size**        | Can handle large amounts of data.                                           | Limited to about 4KB per cookie.                                       |
| **Security**         | More secure as data resides on the server; only a session ID is exposed.    | Less secure since data is stored on the client; vulnerable to theft if not protected. |
| **Lifetime**         | Typically lasts until the browser is closed or the session expires.        | Can have custom expiration dates; persistent across browser sessions if set. |
| **Performance**      | Requires server memory and management; may impact scalability.              | Reduces server storage needs but increases data transfer with each request. |
| **Usage**            | Storing sensitive information like user authentication state.              | Storing non-sensitive data like user preferences or shopping cart items. |
| **Accessibility**    | Accessible only to the server.                                             | Accessible to both client and server (unless HttpOnly).                |
| **Management**       | Managed by the server-side application.                                    | Managed by the client’s browser; sent with each HTTP request to the relevant domain/path. |
| **Dependency**       | Depends on server resources and session management logic.                  | Independent of server resources; relies on client’s browser capabilities. |
| **Examples**         | PHP sessions, ASP.NET sessions, Java HTTP sessions.                        | Cookies set via `Set-Cookie` header, JavaScript `document.cookie`.      |

- Key Points

    - **Security**: Sessions are generally more secure as data is kept on the server. Cookies can be secured using attributes like `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`.
    - **Persistence**: Cookies can persist across browser sessions if configured, whereas sessions typically expire after the browser is closed or after a timeout.
    - **Data Handling**: Sessions are suitable for storing sensitive and large data, while cookies are ideal for small, non-sensitive information.
    - **Performance**: Using sessions can consume server resources, potentially affecting scalability. Cookies can increase the size of HTTP requests since they are sent with every request.

- Use Cases

    - **Session**:
    - User authentication and maintaining login state.
    - Storing shopping cart data in e-commerce applications.
    
    - **Cookie**:
    - Remembering user preferences and settings.
    - Tracking user behavior for analytics.

## 10. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
### Using Session and Cookie to Maintain User Information Across an Application

To keep user information persistent across an application, **sessions** and **cookies** work together to manage and maintain state in a stateless HTTP environment.

#### **How It Works**

1. **User Authentication**
   - When a user logs in, the server authenticates the credentials.

2. **Session Creation**
   - Upon successful authentication, the server creates a **session** to store user-specific data (e.g., user ID, roles).
   - A unique **Session ID** is generated to identify this session.

3. **Storing Session ID in a Cookie**
   - The server sends the **Session ID** to the client within a **cookie** using the `Set-Cookie` header.
   - Example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: SESSIONID=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
     ```

4. **Client Stores the Cookie**
   - The browser stores the cookie and automatically includes it in subsequent HTTP requests to the server.

5. **Session Retrieval**
   - For each incoming request, the server reads the **Session ID** from the cookie.
   - It then retrieves the corresponding session data from the server-side storage.

6. **Maintaining State**
   - The server uses the session data to maintain user state, such as keeping the user logged in, storing preferences, or managing shopping cart contents.

#### **Key Components**

- **Cookie Attributes for Security**
  - `HttpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
  - `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
  - `SameSite`: Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests, helping prevent CSRF attacks.
  - `Path` and `Domain`: Define the scope of the cookie.

- **Session Management**
  - **Server-Side Storage**: Sessions can be stored in memory, databases, or distributed caches (e.g., Redis) to support scalability.
  - **Session Timeout**: Sessions expire after a period of inactivity to enhance security.
  - **Session Regeneration**: Regenerating Session IDs after authentication to prevent session fixation.

#### **Example Workflow**

1. **Login Request**
   - User submits login form.
   - Server verifies credentials.

2. **Session and Cookie Setup**
   - Server creates a session with user data.
   - Server sends a `Set-Cookie` header with the Session ID.

3. **Subsequent Requests**
   - Browser sends the cookie with each request.
   - Server retrieves session data using the Session ID from the cookie.
   - Application personalizes responses based on session data.

4. **Logout**
   - User logs out.
   - Server invalidates the session.
   - Server instructs the browser to delete the session cookie.

#### **Best Practices**

- **Secure Cookies**: Always set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and appropriate `SameSite` attributes.
- **Minimal Data in Cookies**: Store only the Session ID in cookies; keep sensitive data on the server.
- **Session Expiration**: Implement reasonable session timeouts and handle session renewal securely.
- **Regenerate Session IDs**: Change Session IDs after privilege changes (e.g., after login) to prevent fixation.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: If storing any sensitive information in cookies is unavoidable, ensure it is encrypted.

#### **Diagram**

```plaintext
[Client Browser]
      |
      |--(1) Login Request-->
      |<--(2) Set-Cookie: SESSIONID=abc123--
      |
      |--(3) Subsequent Requests with Cookie-->
      |<--(4) Server Retrieves Session Data--
```

## 11. What is the spring security filter?

**Spring Security Filters** are components in the Spring Security framework that intercept and process HTTP requests to enforce security policies such as authentication and authorization. They are part of a **filter chain** that applies a series of security checks before allowing access to protected resources.

#### **Key Concepts**

- **Filter Chain**
  - A sequence of filters that each handle specific security tasks.
  - Managed by `FilterChainProxy`, which delegates requests to the appropriate filters.

- **Filter Responsibilities**
  - **Authentication**: Verifying user credentials.
  - **Authorization**: Ensuring users have the necessary permissions.
  - **Session Management**: Handling user sessions and context.
  - **CSRF Protection**: Preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.
  - **CORS Handling**: Managing cross-origin resource sharing policies.

#### **Important Spring Security Filters**

1. **SecurityContextPersistenceFilter**
   - Maintains the `SecurityContext` across requests.
   - Loads the security context from the session at the start of a request and stores it at the end.

2. **UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter**
   - Processes form-based login requests.
   - Extracts username and password from the request and attempts authentication.

3. **BasicAuthenticationFilter**
   - Handles HTTP Basic authentication.
   - Extracts and validates credentials from the `Authorization` header.

4. **BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter**
   - Processes OAuth2 Bearer Token authentication.
   - Validates JWTs or other token types in the `Authorization` header.

5. **ExceptionTranslationFilter**
   - Translates security exceptions into HTTP responses.
   - Handles access denied and authentication entry point exceptions.

6. **FilterSecurityInterceptor**
   - Enforces authorization decisions based on security metadata.
   - Checks if the authenticated user has access to the requested resource.

7. **CsrfFilter**
   - Provides CSRF protection by validating tokens in state-changing requests.

8. **CorsFilter**
   - Manages CORS policies to control cross-origin requests.

#### **Configuration**

- **Java Configuration**
  - Define security filters using `HttpSecurity` in a `@Configuration` class.
  - Example:
    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http
                .csrf().disable()
                .authorizeRequests()
                    .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                    .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin()
                    .loginPage("/login")
                    .permitAll();
        }
    }
    ```

- **Custom Filters**
  - Add custom filters by extending `OncePerRequestFilter` and registering them in the filter chain.
  - Example:
    ```java
    public class CustomFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
        @Override
        protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
                                        HttpServletResponse response,
                                        FilterChain filterChain)
                                        throws ServletException, IOException {
            // Custom filtering logic
            filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }

    // Registration
    http.addFilterBefore(new CustomFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    ```

#### **Lifecycle**

1. **Request Arrival**
   - Incoming HTTP request enters the filter chain.

2. **Filter Processing**
   - Each filter performs its specific security task (e.g., authentication).

3. **Decision Making**
   - Filters may allow the request to proceed or block it based on security rules.

4. **Response Handling**
   - After processing, the response flows back through the filter chain to the client.

#### **Benefits**

- **Modularity**
  - Each filter handles a distinct aspect of security, promoting separation of concerns.

- **Flexibility**
  - Easily customize and extend the filter chain to meet specific security requirements.

- **Integration**
  - Seamlessly integrates with other Spring components and external authentication providers.

#### **Best Practices**

- **Order Matters**
  - Arrange filters in the correct order to ensure proper security enforcement.

- **Minimize Custom Filters**
  - Use built-in filters whenever possible to leverage tested security mechanisms.

- **Secure Configuration**
  - Properly configure security settings (e.g., CSRF, CORS) to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## 12. Explain bearer token and how JWT works.
### Bearer Token
A **Bearer Token** is an access token that grants the holder permission to access protected resources. It is typically included in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests:

### Authorization: Bearer <token>

- **Usage**: Simplifies authentication by allowing token-based access without additional credentials.
- **Security**: Must be transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception; possession of the token is sufficient for access.

### JSON Web Token (JWT)

**JWT** is a compact, self-contained token used for securely transmitting information between parties.

- **Structure**: Consists of three parts separated by dots:
  1. **Header**: Specifies the type (`JWT`) and signing algorithm.
  2. **Payload**: Contains claims or data (e.g., user ID, roles).
  3. **Signature**: Ensures the token's integrity using a secret or private key.
  
- **How It Works**:
  1. **Creation**: Server generates a JWT after authenticating a user.
  2. **Transmission**: Sent to the client, usually in the `Authorization` header.
  3. **Verification**: Server validates the signature and claims on each request.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Stateless**: No need to store session data on the server.
  - **Scalable**: Suitable for distributed systems and microservices.
  
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Use strong signing algorithms.
  - Implement expiration times.
  - Protect against token theft by securing storage and transmission.

## 13. Explain how do we store sensitive user information such as password and credit card number in DB? 
### Storing Sensitive User Information in Databases

#### **1. Passwords**

- **Hashing with Salt**
  - **Use Strong Hashing Algorithms**: Utilize algorithms like **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **scrypt** which are designed to be computationally intensive.
  - **Unique Salt**: Generate a unique salt for each password to prevent rainbow table attacks.
  
- **Never Store Plain-Text Passwords**
  - Always store only the hashed and salted version of passwords.

- **Example Workflow**
  1. **User Registration**
     - User creates a password.
     - Server generates a unique salt.
     - Password is hashed with the salt.
     - Store the salt and hashed password in the database.
  2. **User Login**
     - User submits password.
     - Server retrieves the salt and hashed password.
     - Hash the submitted password with the retrieved salt.
     - Compare hashes for authentication.

#### **2. Credit Card Numbers**

- **Encryption**
  - **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Use strong encryption standards like **AES-256** to encrypt credit card numbers before storing them in the database.
  - **Key Management**: Store encryption keys securely, preferably using a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** or a **Key Management Service (KMS)**.

- **Tokenization**
  - **Replace Sensitive Data**: Substitute credit card numbers with non-sensitive tokens that can be mapped back to the original data if needed.
  - **Reduce Scope**: Limits the exposure of actual credit card data within the system.

- **PCI DSS Compliance**
  - **Adhere to Standards**: Follow the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** guidelines for handling and storing credit card information.
  - **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic security assessments to ensure compliance.

#### **3. General Best Practices**

- **Access Controls**
  - **Least Privilege**: Grant database access only to authorized personnel and services.
  - **Role-Based Access**: Implement roles to manage permissions effectively.

- **Encryption In Transit**
  - **Use TLS/SSL**: Ensure data is encrypted during transmission between the client and server.

- **Secure Storage Solutions**
  - **Use Trusted Providers**: Leverage secure database services that offer built-in encryption and security features.

- **Regular Security Audits**
  - **Vulnerability Assessments**: Perform regular checks to identify and mitigate security risks.
  - **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks to test the robustness of security measures.

- **Environment Variables for Secrets**
  - **Avoid Hard-Coding**: Store encryption keys and other secrets in environment variables or secure vaults instead of in the codebase.

- **Data Minimization**
  - **Store Only Necessary Data**: Limit the storage of sensitive information to what is absolutely required for functionality.

- **Logging and Monitoring**
  - **Track Access**: Monitor access to sensitive data and maintain logs for auditing purposes.
  - **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

## 14. Compare UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter?
### Comparing UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, and AuthenticationFilter

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                 | **Role in Authentication Process**                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UserDetailsService**  | Interface to retrieve user-related data.                                       | **Loads User Data**: Fetches user information (e.g., username, password, roles) from a data source for authentication. |
| **AuthenticationProvider** | Interface that performs authentication logic.                                | **Authenticates Credentials**: Validates the provided credentials against user data retrieved by `UserDetailsService`. Can support multiple authentication methods. |
| **AuthenticationManager** | Central interface for managing authentication.                                 | **Delegates Authentication**: Coordinates multiple `AuthenticationProvider`s to authenticate a user. Typically uses `ProviderManager` as the default implementation. |
| **AuthenticationFilter** | Abstract class for processing authentication requests (e.g., login).            | **Intercepts Requests**: Captures authentication requests from HTTP (e.g., form submissions), extracts credentials, and initiates the authentication process via `AuthenticationManager`. Examples include `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`. |

#### **Workflow Overview**

1. **AuthenticationFilter**
   - Intercepts login requests (e.g., `/login`).
   - Extracts user credentials from the request.
   - Creates an `Authentication` token and passes it to the `AuthenticationManager`.

2. **AuthenticationManager**
   - Receives the `Authentication` token from the filter.
   - Iterates through configured `AuthenticationProvider`s to find one that supports the token.
   - Delegates the authentication process to the appropriate `AuthenticationProvider`.

3. **AuthenticationProvider**
   - Uses `UserDetailsService` to load user data based on the provided username.
   - Compares the submitted credentials with the stored data (e.g., password hashing).
   - Returns a fully authenticated `Authentication` object upon successful verification.

4. **UserDetailsService**
   - Fetches user details from a database, LDAP, or another user store.
   - Provides user information required for authentication and authorization.

#### **Key Points**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `UserDetailsService` handles data retrieval.
  - `AuthenticationProvider` manages the authentication logic.
  - `AuthenticationManager` orchestrates the overall authentication process.
  - `AuthenticationFilter` interfaces with HTTP requests to initiate authentication.

- **Flexibility**:
  - Multiple `AuthenticationProvider`s can be configured to support different authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, OAuth).

- **Customization**:
  - Developers can implement custom versions of these components to tailor the authentication process to specific requirements.

#### **Example Use Case**

- **Form-Based Login**:
  1. User submits login form.
  2. `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` captures the request and extracts credentials.
  3. The filter sends an `Authentication` token to the `AuthenticationManager`.
  4. `AuthenticationManager` delegates to `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
  5. `DaoAuthenticationProvider` uses `UserDetailsService` to load user details.
  6. Credentials are validated, and authentication succeeds or fails accordingly.


## 15. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
### Disadvantages of Sessions and Solutions to Overcome Them

#### **1. Scalability Issues**
- **Disadvantage**:
  - **Server Load**: Storing sessions on individual servers can lead to high memory usage.
  - **Distributed Systems**: Managing sessions across multiple servers complicates scalability and load balancing.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - **Centralized Session Stores**: Use databases or in-memory data stores like **Redis** or **Memcached** to store sessions centrally, allowing all servers to access session data.
  - **Stateless Authentication**: Implement **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to eliminate the need for server-side session storage, enhancing scalability in distributed environments.
  - **Load Balancing with Sticky Sessions**: Configure load balancers to use sticky sessions, ensuring a user’s requests are consistently routed to the same server. *(Note: This can limit scalability and flexibility.)*

#### **2. Resource Consumption**
- **Disadvantage**:
  - **Memory Usage**: Active sessions consume server memory, which can be significant with many concurrent users.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - **Session Timeout Management**: Implement appropriate session timeouts to free up resources from inactive sessions.
  - **Efficient Session Data**: Store only essential information in sessions to minimize memory footprint.
  - **Use Lightweight Session Stores**: Opt for efficient storage mechanisms like **Redis** that handle large volumes of session data with minimal resource usage.

#### **3. Complexity in Session Management**
- **Disadvantage**:
  - **Session Persistence**: Ensuring sessions persist across server restarts or deployments adds complexity.
  - **Synchronization**: Keeping session data synchronized across multiple servers can be challenging.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - **Centralized Session Management**: Utilize centralized session stores to manage persistence and synchronization automatically.
  - **Framework Support**: Leverage frameworks and tools that provide built-in session management features, reducing the need for custom solutions.
  - **Automated Session Handling**: Implement automated mechanisms for session replication and failover to ensure consistency and availability.

#### **4. Security Concerns**
- **Disadvantage**:
  - **Session Hijacking**: Attackers can steal session IDs to impersonate users.
  - **Session Fixation**: Attackers set a user’s session ID to a known value to hijack the session after authentication.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - **Secure Session IDs**: Generate strong, random session IDs to prevent guessing and ensure they are transmitted securely using **HTTPS**.
  - **HttpOnly and Secure Flags**: Set cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to protect session IDs from client-side scripts and ensure they are sent only over secure connections.
  - **Regenerate Session IDs**: Change session IDs after authentication to prevent session fixation attacks.
  - **Implement CSRF Protection**: Use **CSRF tokens** to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks that can exploit sessions.
  - **Session Monitoring and Invalidation**: Monitor for suspicious activities and invalidate sessions proactively when anomalies are detected.

#### **5. Dependency on Server Resources**
- **Disadvantage**:
  - **Server Dependency**: Sessions tie user state to server resources, making it harder to migrate users between servers or services.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - **Decouple State from Servers**: Use external session stores or stateless authentication methods like **JWT** to decouple user state from individual server instances.
  - **Microservices Architecture**: Design microservices to handle authentication and session management centrally, reducing dependency on individual servers.

## 16. how to get value from application.properties in Spring security?
### Accessing `application.properties` Values in Spring Security

1. **Define Properties**: Add your security-related properties in the `application.properties` file.

2. **Inject with `@Value`**:
   - Use the `@Value` annotation to inject individual property values into your security configuration classes.

3. **Use `@ConfigurationProperties`**:
   - Bind a group of related properties to a dedicated configuration class for better organization and ease of use.

4. **Apply in Security Config**:
   - Utilize the injected values within your Spring Security configuration to customize authentication and authorization rules based on external settings.

#### Key Methods
- **`@Value` Annotation**: For injecting single property values.
- **`@ConfigurationProperties`**: For binding multiple related properties to a POJO.

## 17. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
### Roles of `configure(HttpSecurity http)` and `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` in Spring Security

#### **`configure(HttpSecurity http)`**

- **Purpose**: Defines the **security rules** for HTTP requests.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Authorization**: Specify which URLs are secured and the required roles or permissions.
  - **Authentication Mechanisms**: Configure login forms, HTTP Basic auth, OAuth, etc.
  - **Security Features**: Enable or disable CSRF protection, configure session management, handle CORS.
  - **Exception Handling**: Define custom access denied or authentication entry points.
- **Usage Example**:
  - Restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.
  - Configure form-based login and logout behavior.

#### **`configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)`**

- **Purpose**: Sets up **authentication providers** and **user details** for verifying user identities.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **User Sources**: Define where and how to retrieve user information (e.g., in-memory, JDBC, LDAP).
  - **Password Encoding**: Specify password hashing mechanisms.
  - **Authentication Providers**: Add custom or built-in providers like `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
- **Usage Example**:
  - Configure in-memory users with roles.
  - Integrate with a database to load user credentials and authorities.

#### **Workflow Integration**

1. **Authentication Setup**:
   - `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` establishes how users are authenticated by defining user sources and password encoders.

2. **Authorization Setup**:
   - `configure(HttpSecurity http)` uses the authentication setup to enforce access rules on HTTP requests based on authenticated user roles and permissions.

#### **Key Points**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - **Authentication (`auth`)**: Focuses on verifying user identities.
  - **Authorization (`http`)**: Focuses on granting or denying access to resources based on authenticated identities.

- **Customization**:
  - Both methods can be overridden to tailor security configurations to specific application needs.
