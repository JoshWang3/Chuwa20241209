Presentation Layer: A JSON structure is made up of viewpoints. It interprets JSON and handles authentication and HTTP requests. After authentication, it enters the business layer for further processing.

Business Layer: It manages all of the business decisions and performs the business validation and consent. 

Persistence Layer: All of the storage logic in this program, including database.

Database Layer: The HTTP request or internet requests are handled by the Controllers from the demonstration layer. Databases may be managed by many databases.

### 5. Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.
Controller Layer -> Service Layer
Receives the HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST) from Postman.

Service Layer <-> Repository Layer
Executes database queries and Sends data back to the Service Layer.

Controller Layer Sends the final response back to Postman (JSON, XML, ... )
