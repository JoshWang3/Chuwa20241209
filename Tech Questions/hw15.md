### Explain and compare following concepts, provide specific examples when doing comparison:
#### Testing related:
#### 1. Unit Testing
-  individual components (functions, methods, or classes) in isolation.
#### 2. Functional Testing
- Ensures that a feature or functionality works as expected according to requirements.
#### 3. Integration Testing
- Verifies that different modules or components work together correctly.
#### 4. Regression Testing
- Ensures that recent changes (e.g., bug fixes or new features) do not break existing functionality.
#### 5. Smoke Testing
- A preliminary test to check if the basic functions of an application are working before more detailed testing.
#### 6. Performance Testing
- Evaluates how a system behaves under different conditions, such as load, stress, or concurrency.
#### 7. A/B Testing
- Compares two versions of a feature to determine which performs better.
#### 8. User Acceptance Testing
- The final testing phase where actual users verify that the system meets their needs before deployment.
#### Environment related:
#### 1. Development
- The environment where developers write, test, and debug code.
- Example: A developer testing a new API locally before pushing it to a shared repository.
#### 2. QA (Quality Assurance)
- A dedicated environment where testers perform various types of testing (e.g., functional, integration, regression).
- Example: Testers verifying a new feature on a separate QA server before approval for staging.
#### 3. Pre-prod/Staging
- A near-production environment used for final testing before deployment.
#### 4. Production
- The live environment where actual users interact with the application.
### 1. List and explain all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md

### 2. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
- **Setup:** This phase puts the the test infrastructure in place. JUnit provides class level setup (@BeforeAll) and method level setup (@BeforeEach). Generally, heavy objects like databse comnections are created in class level setup while lightweight objects like test objects are reset in the method level setup.
- **Test Execution:** In this phase, the test execution and assertion happen. The execution result will signify a success or failure.
- **Cleanup:** This phase is used to cleanup the test infrastructure setup in the first phase. Just like setup, teardown also happen at class level (@AfterAll) and method level (@AfterEach).

### 3. Explain parameterized testing?
- Parameterized testing is a software testing technique that runs the same test multiple times with different input data.
### 4. Explain Mockito and PowerMock .
- ockito is a popular Java mocking framework primarily used for creating mock objects to isolate and test individual components in a unit test
- PowerMock is an extension of Mockito that provides additional capabilities for mocking more complex scenarios like static methods, final classes, private methods, and constructors, which are not readily supported by standard Mockito functionality
### 5. Compare @Mock and @InjectMock
- @Mock is used to create mock objects of classes or interfaces and applied to fields that need to be mocked. . 
- @InjectMocks is used to inject mocks into the class under test and applied to the instance of the class under test to inject the mocked dependencies.
### 6. Explain stubbing .
- stubbing is the process of defining the behavior of a mock object. You specify what value a mock object should return when a particular method is called on it. This allows you to isolate the code you're testing from its dependencies, making your tests more focused and reliable.
### 7. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
- ArgumentMatchers allow you to specify flexible parameter matching instead of exact values in Mockito stubbing and verification.
- They help keep tests readable and maintainable, especially when exact parameter values are difficult to predict or not relevant to the test.
- Common examples include any(), eq(value), anyString(), or the more powerful argThat(predicate).
### 8. Compare @spy and @Mock?
- **`@Spy`** → Partial mock of a real object. Ideal if you want to keep real behavior but override or stub specific methods.
- **`@Mock`** → Full mock with no real behavior. Useful for isolating and controlling the object’s responses entirely.
### 9. Explain Assertion .
- Assertions are critical for validating that your Spring components, endpoints, and application logic function correctly.
```assertEquals(expected, actual)```: Checks that two values are equal.
```assertTrue(condition)```: Checks that a boolean expression is true.
```assertFalse(condition)```: Checks that a boolean expression is false.
```assertNotNull(object)```: Checks that an object is not null.
```assertThrows(exceptionClass, executable)```: Checks that a given code block throws a specified exception.
### 10. Add unit tests for CommentServiceImpl under Redbook->branch 10_testing (fork or copy the project https://github.com/CTYue/springboot-redbook),
#### 1. Enrich logics inside ```CommentServiceImpl``` methods, add if-else conditions in each methods.
#### 2. In ```CommentServiceImpl```, add following method, remove modelMapper dependency, and replace all ```modelMapper.map()``` with this method, write unit test for ```commentServiceMapperUtil```
#### 3. method coverage and branch coverage for CommentServiceImpl should be 100% (as much as you can), .
   ```public static CommentDto commentServiceMapperUtil(Comment comment) {
        ModelMapper modelMapper = new ModelMapper();
        return modelMapper.map(comment, CommentDto.class);
   }```
