1. Unit Testing: Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or functions.
2. Functional testing: Functional testing verifies that an application’s features work according to the specified requirements.
3. Integration testing: Integration testing verifies that different modules or components work together as expected.
4. Regression testing: Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not introduce new bugs in existing functionality.
5. Smoke testing: Smoke testing is a preliminary test to check if the software’s basic functionalities work.
6. Performance Testing: Performance testing evaluates how an application behaves under different loads.
7. A/B Testing: A/B testing compares two different versions of a feature to determine which performs better.
8. User Acceptance Testing: UAT is the final phase of testing where real users validate that the system meets business requirements.
9. Development Environment: A local or internal environment where developers write and test code.
10. QA (Quality Assurance) Environment: A dedicated environment for functional and regression testing.
11. Pre-Production (Staging) Environment: A near-production environment used for final testing.
12. Production Environment:  The live environment where end users interact with the application.



1. 
   @Test	Marks a method as a test case.
   @BeforeEach	Runs before each test method to set up test data.
   @AfterEach	Runs after each test method to clean up resources.
   @BeforeAll	Runs once before all tests in a class (must be static).
   @AfterAll	Runs once after all tests in a class (must be static).
   @Disabled	Disables a test case (useful for skipping tests).
   @DisplayName("Custom Name")	Provides a custom test name for better readability.
   @RepeatedTest(5)	Runs the test multiple times.
   @Tag("slow")	Groups tests to enable selective execution.
   @Nested	Allows inner test classes to create grouped test cases.
   @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)	Enables Mockito in JUnit 5 tests.
   @ParameterizedTest	Used for parameterized testing.
   @CsvSource({ "1,2,3", "4,5,9" })	Supplies test parameters in CSV format.
2. 
   @BeforeAll – Executes once before any test in the class (static method).
   @BeforeEach – Runs before each test method (setup).
   @Test – Executes the test case.
   @AfterEach – Runs after each test method (cleanup).
   @AfterAll – Executes once after all tests (static method).
3. Parameterized tests allow running the same test multiple times with different inputs.
4.
Mockito is a popular Java mocking framework used to create test doubles for unit tests.
PowerMock is an extension of Mockito
5.
@Mock	Creates a mock object but does not inject it into the tested class.
@InjectMocks	Injects mock dependencies into the tested object.
6. Stubbing is when we define mock behavior in Mockito.
7. ArgumentMatchers allow flexible parameter matching.
8. Assertions are used in JUnit to validate test results.
