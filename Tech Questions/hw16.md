### 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md

### 2. Explain monolithic architecture, service oriented architecture and Micro service architecture.
- Monolithic apps consist of interdependent, indivisible units and feature very low development speed. 
- SOA is broken into smaller, moderately coupled services, and features slow development. 
- Microservices are very small, loosely coupled independent services and feature rapid continuous development.
### 3. Document the microservice architeture and core components
- **Microservices:** Small, loosely coupled services that handle specific business functions, each focusing on a distinct capability.
- **API Gateway:** Acts as a central entry point for external clients also they manage requests, authentication and route the requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Service Registry and Discovery:** Keeps track of the locations and addresses of all microservices, enabling them to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple service instances and prevent any of the microservice from being overwhelmed.
- **Containerization:** Docker encapsulate microservices and their dependencies and orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage their deployment and scaling.
- **vent Bus/Message Broker:** Facilitates communication between microservices, allowing pub/sub asynchronous interaction of events between components/microservices.
- **Database per Microservice:** Each microservice usually has its own database, promoting data autonomy and allowing for independent management and scaling.
- **Caching:** Cache stores frequently accessed data close to the microservice which improved performance by reducing the repetitive queries.
- **Fault Tolerance and Resilience Components:** Components like circuit breakers and retry mechanisms ensure that the system can handle failures gracefully, maintaining overall functionality.
### 4. Explain Resilience patterns? Explain circuit breaker with Spring Cloud Hystrix code example.
- Resilience patterns (Circuit Breaker, Retry, Fallback, Bulkhead, Timeout, etc.) help distributed microservices handle transient failures, overloads, and unexpected downtime gracefully.
- circuit breaker is particularly critical for preventing cascading failures, controlling resource usage, and improving system stability.
```
@Component

public class PaymentService {



    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "getPaymentFallback") 

    public Payment getPaymentDetails(String paymentId) {

        // Call external payment service to retrieve payment details

        // ... 

    }



    public Payment getPaymentFallback(String paymentId) {

        // Fallback logic, return a default payment or error message

        return new Payment(paymentId, "Fallback Payment", "N/A");

    }

}
```
### 5. Explain load balancing algorithms.
- A load balancer is a software or hardware device that keeps any one server from becoming overloaded. A load balancing algorithm is the logic that a load balancer uses to distribute network traffic between servers (an algorithm is a set of predefined rules).

- two primary approaches to load balancing:
- **Dynamic load balancing** uses algorithms that take into account the current state of each server and distribute traffic accordingly. 
- **Static load balancing** distributes traffic without making these adjustments.
### 6. Explain API Gateway.
- API gateway is a system that manages API calls, or requests from clients to applications and services. It acts as a single entry point for these requests, and performs actions like authentication, authorization, and routing.
### 7. Explain service discovery and service registry
- **Service Discovery** is the mechanism by which microservices automatically find and communicate with other services without needing to hardcode their locations (IP addresses or ports).
- **Service Registry** is a database (or system) that stores the locations (IP/port) of all running service instances and allows other services to discover them.
### 8. List Spring Cloud Modules that serve as Microservice components (e.g. Euerka for Service Discovery)
