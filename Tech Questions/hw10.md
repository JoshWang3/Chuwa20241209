# Homework 10

## 1. Is `System.out.print` thread safe? Write code using thread pool and multi-thread to answer this question.
- Yes. Each System.out.print(...) call is internally synchronized, so you won’t see garbled (partial) output—even though multiple threads can interleave their prints.
  ```
  import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
  import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

  public class SysOutTest {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
              final int threadId = i;
              pool.submit(() -> {
                  for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                      System.out.print("Thread-" + threadId + " ");
                  }
              });
          }
          pool.shutdown();
      }
  }
  ```
- **Result**: The output may interleave by thread, but each print(...) is complete (no half-printed fragments).

## 2. Why do we NOT use `System.out.print` for logging in Spring? Why do we use loggers such as Log4j?

- Reasons to Avoid `System.out.print`:
  - **Limited Functionality:** Lacks log levels, formatting, and advanced features.
  - **Performance Issues:** Synchronous I/O can slow down applications.
  - **No Configuration:** Cannot easily adjust logging behavior without code changes.
  - **Poor Management:** Difficult to handle log rotation, filtering, and multiple destinations.

- Advantages of Loggers Like Log4j:
  - **Flexible Log Levels:** DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR for better control.
  - **Configurable Outputs:** Direct logs to files, consoles, or remote systems.
  - **Performance Optimizations:** Asynchronous logging and efficient I/O handling.
  - **Advanced Features:** Log formatting, rotation, and integration with monitoring tools.
  - **Maintainability:** Standardized and manageable logging across the application.


## 3. If `System.out.print` is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?
- **Limited Functionality:** No support for log levels or structured formatting.
- **Performance Issues:** Synchronous I/O can degrade application performance.
- **Lack of Configurability:** Cannot easily change logging behavior without code changes.
- **Poor Log Management:** No features like log rotation, filtering, or multiple output destinations.
- **Maintainability:** Hard to standardize and manage logs in large or complex applications.
- **Integration Challenges:** Difficult to integrate with monitoring and analysis tools.

## 4. Explain slf4j logging levels, and what is included in slf4j logs.

- **SLF4J Logging Levels**
  - **ERROR**: Critical issues, e.g., system crashes.
  - **WARN**: Potential problems, e.g., deprecated APIs.
  - **INFO**: General progress, e.g., app startup.
  - **DEBUG**: Detailed debug info, e.g., variable states.
  - **TRACE**: Fine-grained debugging, e.g., execution paths.
- **Included in SLF4J Logs**
  - **Message**: Log content.
  - **Level**: Severity (ERROR, INFO, etc.).
  - **Timestamp**: Log time.
  - **Logger Name**: Source class/package.
  - **Thread Name**: Thread generating the log.
  - **Exception**: Stack trace (if applicable).
  - **Custom Fields**: Context info via MDC (e.g., user ID).
