### 1. Is System.out.print thread safe?
**Write code using thread pool and multi-thread to answer this question.**
- Yes, System.out.print (and other similar methods on System.out) are thread-safe in the sense that individual calls are synchronized internally by the PrintStream.

- However, if you have a sequence of separate print calls, those calls can interleave with calls from other threads. This may result in mixed or interleaved output if not controlled, because while each individual call is thread-safe, there is no atomicity across multiple calls.
```
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // creat a threadPool of fixed size 2
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // print 'A' 10 times
        executor.submit(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.print("A");
            }
            System.out.println();  
        });

        // print 'B' 10 times
        executor.submit(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.print("B");
            }
            System.out.println();  
        });

        // shutdown the thread pool
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
The result can be:
```
AAAABBBBAA
BBBBBAAAAA
```
Or:
```
AAAABBBBAA
BBBBBAAAAA
```

### 2. Why do we NOT use ```System.out.print``` for logging in Spring? Why do we use loggers such as Log4j?
- ```System.out.println()``` offers no control over output destination, filtering by severity, formatting, and has performance drawbacks, it’s unsuitable for complex logging needs.
- Loggers provide a more robust and flexible way to handle logging in Java applications. They allow for different levels of logging, multiple output destinations, and better performance.
### 3. If System.out.print is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?
- ```System.out.println()``` offers no control over output destination, filtering by severity, formatting, and has performance drawbacks, it’s unsuitable for complex logging needs.
### 4. Explain slf4j logging levels, and what is included in slf4j logs.
- SLF4J Logging Levels:
```
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARN
ERROR
```
- What SLF4J Logs Usually Include:
```
Timestamp
Log level
Logger or class name
Thread information
The log message
Exception stack traces (if applicable)
```
### 5. Write a Spring boot Rest application (using Spring Web starter on ) from Scratch, prove it is a multithreaded application by nature (without explicit configuration) according to logs.

### 6. For your application in 5, make packaging type to war , deploy it to an external tomcat server,document how to deploy it, upload screenshot of each steps.

### 7. For your application in 5, write a global exception handler to render java exceptions to corresponding http statuses, explain your code with comments.

### 8. demo spring actuator, which is a built-in module of your application.
