# HW10
## Questions:

### 1. Is System.out.print thread safe? Write code using thread pool and multi-thread to answer this question.
Yes, please check Coding/HW10/Q1.java

### 2. Why do we NOT use System.out.print for logging in Spring? Why do we use loggers such as Log4j?
Compare to Log4j, `System.out.print` don't have logging levels and custom configurations. In addition, log4j's performance is better (async logging)

### 3. If System.out.print is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?
Yes, for the disadvantage of it: 
1. low performance 
2. Can't control the file size or output destination 
3. hard to customize

### 4. Explain SLF4J logging levels, and what is included in SLF4J logs.
static final Level:
1. OFF
   The OFF has the highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
   static final Level
2. FATAL
   The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
   static final Level
3. ERROR
   The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
   static final Level
4. WARN
   The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
5. INFO
   The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
   static final Level
6. DEBUG
   The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
   static final Level
7. TRACE
   The TRACE Level designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG level.
   static final int
8. ALL
   The ALL has the lowest possible rank and is intended to turn on all logging.
   static final Level

SLF4J logging includes timestamps, thread names, log levels, custom message, stack trace (if needed).

### 5. Write a Spring Boot REST Application (using Spring Web Starter) from scratch, prove it is a multi-threaded application by nature (without explicit configuration) according to logs.
Please check HW10/RestApplication/.../controller/ThreadTestController.java
### 6. For your application in 5, make the packaging type to war, deploy it to an external Tomcat server, document how to deploy it, and upload screenshots of each step.
1. create war file by `mvn clean package` command
2. copy the war file to /webapp
3. connect tomcat server

### 7. For your application in 5, write a global exception handler to render Java exceptions to corresponding HTTP statuses, explain your code with comments.
Please check HW10/RestApplication/.../controller/TestExceptionController.java and exception/GlobalExceptionManager.java
