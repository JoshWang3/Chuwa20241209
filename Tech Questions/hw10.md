### 1. Is System.out.print thread safe?

Yes. 
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadSafetyTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 5 threads
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        // Task to print messages
        Runnable printTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.print(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i + " \n");
            }
        };
        // Submit the printTask to the thread pool multiple times
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executorService.submit(printTask);
        }
        // Shutdown the thread pool
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### 2. Why do we not use System.out.print for logging in Spring? Whu do we use loggers such as Log4j?

Because System.out.print lacks some features, such as log levels, log formatting, and log configuration. Loggers like Log4j provide these features, making it easier to manage and customize logging in a Spring application.

### 3. If System.out.print is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?

- Performance overhead: System.out.print can be slower compared to logging frameworks like Log4j, especially when logging large amounts of data.
- Unstructured output: System.out.print does not provide a way to format log messages or categorize them based on log levels.
- Lack of configurability: System.out.print does not allow for configuration of log levels, log output destinations, or log formatting.
- No Thread Context Information: it doesn't provide information like timestamps, thread names and log levels.

### 4. Explain slf4j logging levels, and what is included in slf4j logs.
- slf4j logging levels:
    - TRACE: The most detailed logging level, used for tracing the flow of the application.
    - DEBUG: Used for debugging purposes, providing detailed information about the application's behavior.
    - INFO: Used to log informational messages that are relevant to the application's operation.
    - WARN: Used to log warning messages that indicate potential issues or unexpected behavior.
    - ERROR: Used to log error messages that indicate critical failures or exceptions.
- slf4j logs typically include:
    - Timestamp: The time when the log message was generated.
    - Log Level: The severity level of the log message (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
    - Thread Name: The name of the thread that generated the log message.
    - Logger Name: The name of the logger that generated the log message.
    - Log Message: The actual log message content.
    - Exception Stack Trace: If an exception is logged, the stack trace is included in the log message.
