# Homework 10
## Spring Logging 

### 1. Is System.out.print thread safe? Write code using thread pool and multi-thread to answer this question.
- Yes, `System.out.print` is thread safe. We can see from the source code of System.out.print that it internally utilizes syncrhonized lock in the implmentation. But, in a multi-threaded environment, the output might still appear jumbled because synchronization only ensures atomic access to the PrintStream, not ordered output across threads. 
```java
 public class PrintThreadSafeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            final int threadId = i;
            executorService.submit(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                    System.out.print("Thread " + threadId + " - Iteration " + j + " | ");
                }
            });
        }
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}
// Outputs
// Thread 0 - Iteration 0 | Thread 0 - Iteration 1 | Thread 1 - Iteration 0 | Thread 0 - Iteration 2 | ...
```

### 2. Why do we NOT use System.out.print for logging in Spring? Why do we use loggers such as Log4j?
- `System.out.print` lacks the flexibility, configurability, and performance required for modern, production-grade software. For example, it outputs directly to the console and does not support essential logging features like different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR), configurable output destinations, or integration with external tools for log analysis. Additionally, it does not allow structured logging, which is crucial for analyzing logs effectively in complex systems.

- On the other hand, logging frameworks such as Log4j, Logback, or SLF4J are designed to address these limitations. They provide advanced features like configurable logging levels, multiple output options (console, file, or remote servers), and support for structured formats like JSON. These frameworks also handle multi-threaded environments more effectively, ensuring logs from different threads remain consistent and readable.

### 3. If System.out.print is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?
- The primary issue with `System.out.print` is **the lack of essential features for modern logging practices**. It is slower and less efficient in performance because writing to the console is a blocking operation and can become a bottleneck when there are many log messages, especially in multi-threaded environments. It is insufficient for handling the demands of scalable, maintainable, and professional-grade applications. If an error occurs, System.out.print does not support stack traces or structured error logging. 

### 4. Explain sif4j logging levels, and what is included in sif4j logs.

- The SLF4J Logging Levels:
1. TRACE: the most detailed level of logging, used for fine-grained diagnostic messages.
2. DEBUG: for debugging information, primarily during development or troubleshooting.
3. INFO: logs informational messages that highlight the progress or state of the application.
4. WARN: indicates potentially harmful situations that are not errors but deserve attention.
5. ERROR: logs serious issues that have occurred, indicating failures that need immediate attention.

- It includes timestamp, log level, thread name, logger name, message, dynamic variables, exception stack trace, and custom metadata.

### 5. Write a Spring boot Rest application (using Spring Web starter on) from Scratch, prove it is a multithreaded application by nature (without explicit configuration) according to logs.

### 6. For your application in 5, make packaging type to war, deploy it to an external tomcat server, document how to deploy it, upload screenshot of each steps.
- see Projects

### 7. For your application in 5, write a global exception handler to render java exceptions to corresponding http statuses, explain your code with comments.
