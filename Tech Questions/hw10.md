### 1. Is System.out.print thread safe?

**Write code using thread pool and multi-thread to answer this question.**

- **Yes**, `System.out.print` is thread-safe because `PrintStream` (used by `System.out`) has **synchronized methods**.
- However, the output may still appear **jumbled or interleaved** when multiple threads write at the same time, especially with partial prints (e.g., `print` vs `println`).

### Test Code Using ThreadPool and Multi-Threading:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class PrintTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.print(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i + " | ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}


```

### 2. Why do we NOT use `System.out.print` for logging in Spring? Why do we use loggers such as Log4j?

#### Reasons NOT to Use `System.out.print`:

- No log levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
- Hard to filter or search logs
- Not configurable (can’t write to files, rotate logs, etc.)
- Poor performance in multi-threaded apps
- Not suitable for production environments

---

#### Why Use Loggers Like Log4j / SLF4J:

- Supports log levels for better control
- Outputs can be customized (console, file, remote server)
- Better performance and thread safety
- Easy to enable/disable logs via configuration
- Integrates with Spring Boot’s logging system

---

### Example (Using SLF4J with Logback - default in Spring Boot):

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@RestController
public class MyController {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyController.class);

    @GetMapping("/test")
    public String test() {
        logger.info("This is an info message.");
        logger.error("This is an error message.");
        return "Check the logs!";
    }
}
```

### 3. If System.out.print is thread-safe, is there any other reason why we dislike it?

Yes. Even though `System.out.print` is thread-safe, there are several reasons why it is not recommended, especially in real-world applications:

1. **No Log Levels**

   - Cannot distinguish between INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.

2. **No Configurability**

   - Cannot change log format, redirect to files, or control output location.

3. **Poor Performance**

   - Writes directly to the console, which is slower and not optimized for high-throughput systems.

4. **Hard to Maintain**

   - Difficult to search, filter, or analyze logs in production.

5. **No Integration**

   - Doesn’t integrate with log management tools or monitoring systems.

6. **No Log Rotation or Archiving**
   - Output grows without limit and can't be managed automatically.

### 4. Explain slf4j logging levels, and what is included in slf4j logs.

#### SLF4J Logging Levels:

SLF4J supports the standard logging levels in order of severity:

1. **TRACE** – Most detailed logs, used for debugging internal flow.
2. **DEBUG** – General debugging information.
3. **INFO** – High-level application events (e.g., startup, shutdown).
4. **WARN** – Potential issues, but the app can still run.
5. **ERROR** – Serious issues that may cause parts of the app to fail.

---

### What Is Included in SLF4J Logs:

- **Timestamp** – When the log entry occurred.
- **Log Level** – TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, etc.
- **Thread Name** – The thread that generated the log.
- **Logger Name** – Usually the class name.
- **Message** – The actual log message.
- **Exception Stack Trace** – If an exception is logged.

---

### 5. Write a Spring boot Rest application (using Spring Web starter on ) from Scratch, prove it is a multithreaded application by nature (without explicit configuration) according to logs.

### 6. For your application in 5, make packaging type to war , deploy it to an external tomcat server,document how to deploy it, upload screenshot of each steps.

### 7. For your application in 5, write a global exception handler to render java exceptions to corresponding http statuses, explain your code with comments.

### 8. demo spring actuator, which is a built-in module of your application.
